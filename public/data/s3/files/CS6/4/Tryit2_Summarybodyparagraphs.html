<title>Second paragraph of your summary</title>
<p>Gomez explains that baseball used to be an Olympic sport.  She points out that there is still hope for baseball to be reinstated in spite of being dropped for lack of international appeal, lack of availability of star players, and bad publicity.    Fortunately, Gomez notes, increased popularity and other changes in the sport mean that there is a real chance that baseball will have a place in the 2020 Summer Olympics, which will be held in Tokyo.  However, a key challenge remains: Major League Baseball has still not overcome its unwillingness to release its players so that they can participate in baseball Olympic events. </p>
