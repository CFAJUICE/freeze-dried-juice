<title>Summary body paragraphs</title>
<p>Anderson shares with his readers the key information provided by Captain Sunshine. Solar power is now less expensive than it has ever been, even in cooler climates like that of the northeastern United States.  Those who have solar panels need not fear a lack of electricity because most solar programs are connected to the electric grid.  Also, it is easy to care for solar panels, which will work fine as long as they are rinsed a few times a year.</p>
<p>To determine if solar panels are the right choice for you, Captain Sunshine suggests that you ask an expert to conduct an assessment.  This evaluation will help you determine the costs and whether any financial incentives can help defray the cost of installation. Some homeowners and communities are concerned about the appearance of the panels, but the presence of solar energy in a community makes a statement about the local commitment to solar power. There is no need to put off installing solar energy, because new developments will likely work with existing solar technologies. Some people believe wind is a good option, but many more places are suited to solar energy.  To decide if solar is right for you, join with members of your community to look into the topic further.</p>
