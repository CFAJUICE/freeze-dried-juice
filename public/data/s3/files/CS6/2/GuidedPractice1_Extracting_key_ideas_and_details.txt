3, 2016) The recent unfortunate incident in our town has created speculation about ways to keep our children out of trouble.&nbsp; The case of Tina Tully (also known as Tiny) remains fresh in the minds of all residents.&nbsp; Tina Tully, eight years old, was recently accused of a series of thefts of musical instruments.&nbsp; When local police eventually caught Tina in the act, she confessed, explaining that she was only &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; one instrument at a time.&nbsp; It happens that she longed to play an instrument, but was not sure which one to choose.&nbsp; So, during a period of several days she sampled a number of musical possibilities, somehow avoiding detection by the staff. She eventually settled on the tuba.&nbsp; When questioned, Tina expressed sadness that her three older brothers had been given access to music lessons while in the local schools.&nbsp; Budget cuts forced the elimination of music programs, so Tina took matters into her own hands.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s a music store owner and police chief to do?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s easy: Tina was forgiven and will perform community service at Tooters weekly for the next three months.&nbsp; Best of all, the store has donated a tuba rental and music lessons to Tina.&nbsp; Happy ending? Not so fast. . .</td></tr></tbody></table><p>&nbsp;</p>","rightText":null,"headerText":"What is this all about?"},{"settings":{"showAudio":1,"showNext":1,"showHeader":0,"hideRightPanel":1,"delayStep":0,"delayRight":0,"showRuler":0,"showRFB":1},"leftText":"<p>What is the first paragraph about?</p><p><jumc ju-mc=\"mc_4b6aa959-6ba4-c32c-cacb-1ff8e64233bc\" style=\"width: 200px;
