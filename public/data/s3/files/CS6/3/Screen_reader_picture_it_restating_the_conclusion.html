<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif; color:#000000'>To restate the conclusion, first read the conclusion and identify the author's key ideas.  Then explain each idea in your own words. </p>   
    
    <h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>The conclusion's key ideas</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif; color:#000000'>Read the conclusion and decide what the author's key ideas are.</p>
    
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif; color:#000000'>The curtain is closing on children's music instruction in our town.  Let's reopen that curtain and bring back the sounds of beautiful instruments, yes, even the tuba.  The show must go on, and all kids should be seen and heard on the stage!  Join us at an information session next Friday night to learn more about how you can be involved.  </p>
       <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
          color:#000000'>The author's key ideas are that music should be brought back to the schools, and that everyone should attend an information session to learn how they can be involved.

color:#552656'>One way to restate the conclusion</span></h2>
        <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
          color:#000000'>To restate the author's idea that music should be brought back to the schools, you could say, "The author wants the reader to agree with him that music belongs in schools." <br>
    For "Attend an information session to learn how you can be involved," you could say, "Citizens can attend an information session to learn more about this." <br>
    Your complete restatement would be: "The author wants the reader to agree with him that music belongs in schools.  Citizens can attend an information session to learn more about this."</p>

     <h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Another way to restate the conclusion</span></h2>
        <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
          color:#000000'>To restate the author's idea that music should be brought back to the schools, you could say, "Currently, music is not taught in schools in town.  It is a valuable subject and schools should bring it back." <br>
    For "Attend an information session to learn how you can be involved," you could say, "There will be an information session to learn about helping bring music back to the schools." <br>
    Your complete restatement would be: "Currently, music is not taught in schools in town.  It is a valuable subject and schools should bring it back.  There will be an information session to learn about helping bring music back to the schools."</p>


 <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
           color:#000000'>Both restatements are correct.  Different readers will explain the conclusion in different ways.
