<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Sentence has one subject</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>If the subject is a singular noun, use a singular verb.  Example: The cat sleeps in the sun.<br>
  If the subject is a plural noun, use a plural verb.  Example: The cats sleep in the sun.  <br>
 If the noun can't be counted, use a singular verb.  Example:  The juice is very fresh.<br>
      Did you know?  Singular regular verbs end in an s, like sleeps.  Plural regular verbs do not, like sleep.</p>
    
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Compound subjects:  Subjects separated by "and" or "or"</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>If subjects are separated by "and", use a plural verb.  Example: Kim and Dave ride the bus.<br>
   If the subjects are separated by "or", match the noun that is closest to the verb.  Example:  Soups or salad comes with your meal.<br>
    Another example:  Salad or soups come with your meal.</p>
    
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Indefinite pronouns as subjects: Anybody, both, each, etc.</span></h2>  
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>If the pronoun is singular, use "is."  Example:  Anybody is welcome to try the pie or cake.   Each is delicious.  Note!  The pronoun "Each" is always singular.  Pronouns that begin with "every" or "any" are also singular. <br>
    If the pronoun is plural, use "are."  Example:  Both are made here at the bakery.  Many are tempted to try them.</p>
    
    <h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Subject is a collective noun or group</span></h2>  
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>If the collective noun is acting as a unit, use a singular verb.  Example:  The committee holds regular meetings.<br>
    If the collective noun is a group acting as individuals, use a plural verb.  Example:  The committee decide how to vote by reviewing the data. <br>
    Note!  If a group is acting as individuals, a writer will often phrase the sentence to make this clear.  The committee members decide how to vote by reviewing the data.</p>
    
    <h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Tricky situations</span></h2>  
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>If the subject is separated from the verb, find the subject and match it!  Example:  The choice of campsites is limited.    The subject is "choice," which is singular, so the verb is singular.<br>
    Another example:  The possibilities for a miserable night are endless.  The  subject is "possibilities," which is plural, so the verb is plural.   Don't be misled by the intervening words!<br>
    To decide whether to start a sentence with "There is" or"There are," find the subject of the sentence and match it!  Example:  There are bears near the camp.   The subject is "bears" so use the plural, "There are."  <br> 
    Another example:  There is a cub with one of the bears.  The subject is "cub" so use the singular, "There is."   <br>
    You can try rephrasing the sentence with the subject first to decide.   Example:  Bears are near the camp.  A cub is with one of the bears.  </p>
