color:#5F9842'>How to form the present tense</span></h3>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>When the verb follows a singular noun or "he," "she," or "it," add an S or E S to the end of the verb.  Example: She runs to catch the train.  <br>
If the action is happening while you're speaking, use "I am" or "I'm" with the I N G form of the verb.  Example:  I am running to catch the train right now.<br>
When an event began in the past and continues into the present, use the verb "have" or "has."  Example:  I have learned a lesson about leaving on time.

<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>For a single event in the past, Add D or E D to the end of the verb.  Example:  The train pulled away.<br>
For two past events, one before the other, use the verb "had."   Example: She had reached the train when it 
pulled away.<br>
Caution! Do not use "had" when describing a single event in the past.<br>

<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Decide when events occurred and use the same tense.<br>
    If the events happened in the past, use the past tense.   Example:  He stubbed his toe and spilled coffee on himself.<br>
    If the events are happening in the present, use the present tense. Example:  He stubs his toe and spills coffee on himself.<br>
    Shift tense only when the events happened at different times.  <br>
    If the events started in the present and shifted to the past, start with the present tense and then shift to the past tense.  Example:   She is happy that she caught the train.<br>
   If the events started in the past and shifted to the future, start with the past tense and then shift to the future tense.  Example:   I almost missed the train and will leave earlier next time.<br>
    Remember! Think about when each event occurred and choose the correct tense.</p>
