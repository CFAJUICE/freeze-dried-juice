<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>There are two ways to fix a sentence fragment. You can write something new to add what the fragment is missing, or you can add the fragment to a complete sentence in your writing.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>You're reviewing an essay you wrote and realize one paragraph has some sentence fragments.</p>

color:#552656'>Editing the paragraph</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The first sentence, "The world is losing its elephant population," has a subject and a verb and is a complete sentence.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The second sentence, "Sanctuaries for elephants offer a carefully planned habitat," also has a subject and a verb and is a complete sentence.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The third sentence, "Highly qualified staff," is a fragment because it's missing a verb. You remove the period and write something new to say what the staff does. Now the sentence is, "Highly qualified staff volunteer to work at the sanctuary."</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The fourth sentence, "These safe havens provide much space," has a subject and a verb and is a complete sentence. However, the next sentence "Because the elephants require the ability to roam," is a fragment because it is a dependent clause without an independent clause to complete the idea. You add the fragment to the complete sentence by removing the period after "these safe havens provide much space" and making "because" lowercase. Now the sentence is, "These safe havens provide much space because the elephants require the ability to roam."</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The last sentence, "seek companionship" is a fragment because it's missing a subject. You add the subject "Elephants" to the beginning and make the "s" in "seek" lowercase to create a complete sentence. Now the sentence is, "Elephants seek companionship."</p>

color:#552656'>Fixed paragraph</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>You fixed all of the sentence fragments! Now the paragraph is, "The world is losing its elephant population. Sanctuaries for elephants offer a carefully planned habitat. Highly qualified staff volunteer to work at the sanctuary. These safe havens provide much space because the elephants require the ability to roam. Elephants seek companionship." </p>
