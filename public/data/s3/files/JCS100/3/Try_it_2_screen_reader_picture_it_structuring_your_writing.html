<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>When you write, it is important to balance your own ideas with the ideas and words of others that you will use as support. Here is one way to structure your writing:</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Think about your topic and read what others have said about it.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Begin with a statement that tells what you believe.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Insert a paraphrase, summary, or direct quotation from a source that confirms, proves, or explains your belief.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Explain the importance of the source material.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Explain the connection between your belief and the source material.</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Example from your used car article</span></h2>  
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The paragraph begins with a statement that tells what you believe: Unfortunately, while many people cherish dreams of owning a brand-new car, buying a new car might not be the best financial decision.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next sentences are a paraphrase of information from an expert that supports your belief: On average, a new car loses 11% of its value as soon as you purchase it. For example, if you pay $25,000 for a car, then its worth immediately decreases to $22,250, even before you drive it one mile (Browning, 2016).</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next sentence states the importance of the source material: That means that your brand new car loses a large chunk of its value as soon as it leaves the lot!</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The last sentences make a connection between your belief and the source: But there is good news for those on a budget and those who want to spend their money wisely. Often, the best solution is to buy a used, or "pre-owned," car.</p>
