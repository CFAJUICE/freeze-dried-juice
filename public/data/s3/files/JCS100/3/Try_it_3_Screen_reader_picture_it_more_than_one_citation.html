<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>If you are including information from different authors or sources, then the citation rules apply to each author or source.   The following two paragraphs use information from three different sources.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The first paragraph begins with your own idea: Another spectacular park is Glacier National Park in Montana.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The second sentence begins with a signal phrase with a date introducing a paraphrase from Trent: According to Trent (2015), the park was established in 1910 as the 10th national park.</p>
