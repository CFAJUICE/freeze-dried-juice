<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>If you are including information from different authors or sources, then the citation rules apply to each author or source.   The following two paragraphs use information from two different sources.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The first paragraph begins with your own idea: Today's cars are much better mechanically than the cars of earlier generations.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The second sentence begins with a signal phrase with a date introducing a quotation from Browning and ends with the page number in parentheses: As Tara Browning (2016) notes in an article for <i>The Consumer Advocate</i>, "A car that looked great on the outside might have had terrible mechanical or electrical problems" (p.40).</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next sentence is a paraphrase from Browning and includes a citation: In fact, cars of the 1970s and 1980s were often unreliable or even dangerous (Browning, 2016).</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next sentence is your own idea: Mechanical improvements have had some surprising side-effects.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next sentence begins with a signal phrase with a date, introducing a paraphrase from Upton: According to Arthur Upton (2017), the quality of today's cars has changed the used car market.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The last sentence of the paragraph begins with a second use of a signal phrase for Upton. The date is not required: Upton points out that some exceptionally reliable models are hard to find used because their owners keep them longer.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The citation pattern starts over with a new paragraph. The second paragraph begins with your own ideas: Cars are easier to repair too! In the 1970s, many cars were difficult to work on, and for that reason repairs were expensive.</p> 
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The third sentence begins with a signal phrase for a quotation from Browning, including a date because this is a new paragraph: According to Tara Browning (2016), "domestic cars and foreign cars were equally bad" (p.40).</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next sentence is your own idea: Today's cars are designed to make it easy for mechanics to fix most problems, which are now diagnosed by hooking the car up to a computer.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next sentence is a paraphrase from Browning and includes a citation: In the old days, repairing a car required a lot of guesswork, but computers now help mechanics pinpoint the exact problem quickly and accurately (Browning, 2016).</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The last sentence is your own idea: Today's used car will be easier and less expensive to repair than the used cars of previous decades.</p>
