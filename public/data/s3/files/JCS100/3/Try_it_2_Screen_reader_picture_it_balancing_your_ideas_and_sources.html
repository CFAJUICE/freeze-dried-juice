color:#000000'>You can use a variety of techniques to negotiate the price of a used car (Wilfred, 2004). One method is called the broken record technique: "No matter what the salesperson says, you just keep repeating, 'I want to pay no more than $X for this car.' By repeating yourself like a broken record, you wear the salesperson down" (Wilfred, 2004, p.12). Another method is the signed-sealed-delivered technique: "When you use this technique, you tell the salesperson, 'I will sign the contract as soon as you agree to the price I think is fair for the car'" (Wilfred, 2004, p. 12). A third technique focuses on mutual respect and finding a price that is fair to both the buyer and the seller (Wilfred, 2004). After all, "a car is a major investment, and you have to plan not only for the purchase price but also the cost of upkeep and maintenance" (Browning, 2016, p.40).</p>

color:#000000'>When you are shopping for a used car, you can use several techniques to make sure you don't exceed your budget. As sales expert Gary Wilfred  tells us, "One highly successful technique is called <i>the broken record</i>. No matter what the salesperson says, you just keep repeating 'I want to pay no more than $X for this car.' By repeating yourself like a broken record, you wear the salesperson down" (p.12). A second technique takes advantage of the desire that salespeople have to make a sale. With this technique, called <i>signed, sealed, delivered,</i> you agree to sign the contract as soon as the salesperson meets your price (Wilfred, 2004). A third technique is based on making sure that both you and the salesperson benefit from the sale. You tell the salesperson that you want a price that helps her make a reasonable profit while not exceeding your own budget (Wilfred, 2004).</p>
