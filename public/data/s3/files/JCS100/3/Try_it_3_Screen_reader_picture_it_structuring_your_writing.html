<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>When you write, it is important to balance your own ideas with the ideas and words of others that you will use as support. Here is one way to structure your writing:</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Think about your topic and read what others have said about it.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Begin with a statement that tells what you believe.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Insert a paraphrase, summary, or direct quotation from a source that confirms, proves, or explains your belief.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Explain the importance of the source material.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Explain the connection between your belief and the source material.</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Example from your hiking article</span></h2>  
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The paragraph begins with a statement that tells what you believe: Dedicated hikers can easily spend a week hiking the many beautiful trails in Yosemite. However, some hikes are much more strenuous than others, and you need to make sure that you are physically ready for the challenge.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next sentences are a direct quotation from an expert that supports your belief: Hiking expert Paula Martinez (2016), author of <i>The Hiker's Guide to Yosemite,</i> suggests, "Before planning any strenuous hikes, visit your doctor to ensure that you are fit enough to handle the rigors of the trail. You should know the distance you will be hiking, and the elevation gain" (p. 52).</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next sentence states the importance of the source material: It is important for hikers to know their own capabilities and limitations.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The last sentence makes a connection between your belief and the source: A doctor's assessment is the safest way to ensure that you are ready for your trip.</p>
