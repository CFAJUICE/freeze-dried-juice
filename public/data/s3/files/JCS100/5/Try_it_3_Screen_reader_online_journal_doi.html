Its many unique geologic formations and geographic qualities, coupled with an extensive trail system make it a favorite spot for nature enthusiasts.  Its many campgrounds, countless miles of trails, and proximity to quaint, picturesque New England towns make it an ideal place to stay nearly any time of the year.   This study seeks to measure the popularity of certain areas of the park at various times of the year.  Specifically, we looked at five major points of interest within the park: Cadillac Mountain, Blue Hill Overlook, Thunder Hole, Jordan Pond, and Otter Cove.  The aim here is to measure the popularity of different areas of Acadia at various times of the year, in order to better direct and manage park resources.</p>
