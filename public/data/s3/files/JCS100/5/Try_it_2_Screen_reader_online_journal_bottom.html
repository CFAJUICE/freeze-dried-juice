    <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif; color:#000000'>As long as the sales profession has existed, customers have dreaded the "pushy" salesperson.  This type of sales representative is seen as a nuisance standing in the way of the customer, the product they want, and the price that seems fair.  They don't facilitate the sales process, but rather make it more daunting and complicated; a complex game of jargon and bargaining that often leaves the customer at a disadvantage.  This can be said of sales in every industry, but it is perhaps the purchasing of a car and negotiating with a car salesperson that produces the most anxiety.  The used-car salesperson in particular has become something of a "boogie-man" to car shoppers&mdash;however it does not have to be that way.  By gaining a few simple insights into the pre-owned auto industry and the motivations of its sales representatives, you can get the car you want for the price you want.</p>
    <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif; color:#000000'>
The first thing to realize is that not all used or pre-owned cars are created equal.   For many, this goes without saying, but it is worth pointing out. Makes and models with a reputation for staying on the road and having a low cost of ownership will naturally cost more than other used cars, and by doing their research upfront, buyers will have more negotiating power on any car they might want to purchase.
