Reason 1 is to acknowledge the ideas of others.  The writer is pointing to a section of his paper that includes the ideas of a medical professor, and the professor is shown in the background .  Reason 2 is to give your readers a chance to follow up and read more.  A reader is using one of the in-text citations in the writer's paper to look up information about something she is interested in.   Reason 3 is to show that your own ideas are supported by experts.  The writer is sitting at a desk with his paper, and 3 different experts are standing behind him in support of what he has written.  Reason 4 is to show off the research and hard work you have done.  The writer is working hard at his desk listing all his references and the reader is holding a sign saying nice job!   Reason 5 is to avoid plagiarism.  The writer is holding his paper with a gold ribbon for good work that is entirely his own.">
