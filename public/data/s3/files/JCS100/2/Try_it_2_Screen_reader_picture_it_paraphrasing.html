color:#000000'>When you use all of the ideas and details from a source, but you use your own words to explain what you mean, you are paraphrasing. In a paraphrase, the writer restates all the information from the source using different words and a different sentence structure.</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;

<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>One highly successful technique is called the broken record. No matter what the salesperson says, you just keep repeating "I want to pay no more than $X for this car." By repeating yourself like a broken record, you wear the salesperson down.</p>

<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>As an example, keep repeating the price you want to pay over and over.</p>

<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The <i>broken record</i> technique entails repeating the same phrase over and over until the salesperson is tired of hearing it. For example, you might tell them over and over that your budget is $7,000 and you won't pay a penny more open parentheses G period Jones comma 2004 close parentheses period.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The paraphrase includes the same main ideas and details as the source. The main idea is to repeat the same phrase over and over, and the detail is the example of what you could say.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The paraphrase is about the same length as the source but uses different wording and sentence structure.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The paraphrase is not enclosed within quotation marks.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The paraphrase includes a citation in parentheses at the end of the last sentence, but before the period.</p>
