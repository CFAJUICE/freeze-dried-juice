<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>If you're not an experienced hiker, you might consider buying a package deal from a tour operator. While these packages can be pricey, they save you a lot of time an energy. The tour company makes your flight arrangements, provides lodging and transportation, and even offers experienced trail guides to bring you to little-known parts of the park. Many of these tour companies offer lower prices just before the start of, or just after the end of, the prime hiking season. If you're willing to be flexible in your plans, you can save a bundle.</p>
