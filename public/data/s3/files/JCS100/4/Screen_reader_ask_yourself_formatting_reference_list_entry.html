<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The formatting of your reference list entry is based on the type of source you are using. To decide what information to include in a reference list entry, ask yourself:</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>What type of source am I using?</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Is your source a book, newspaper, magazine, journal, image, video, or something else? Once you understand what type of source you've used, next ask yourself:</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>What is the basic information about my source?</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>For most types of sources you will need to find the names of the author or authors, the date of publication, the title of the work, and if the work comes from a newspaper, magazine, or journal, the title of that publication as well.  Once you've found the basic information about your source, next ask yourself:</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Is my source online?</span></h2>  
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>If it is, does it have a DOI? This information will need to be included as well.  If there is no DOI, include the URL in the reference list entry.</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Finally, what additional information do I need for this type of source?</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Some types of sources require additional information. For example, reference list entries for images, photographs, and artwork require the medium that was used to present the artwork's subject matter.</p>
