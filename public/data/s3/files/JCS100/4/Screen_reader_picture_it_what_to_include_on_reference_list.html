<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>For each source included in an in-text citation in your document, you need to include an entry on a separate list of references at the end of your document. To decide what sources to include on your list of references:</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Review the in-text citations that you included in your writing.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Each source that is mentioned in an in-text citation should have a corresponding entry on your list of references, except for personal communications.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Your list of references should not include sources you read but did not use in your writing.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>When you cite the same source multiple times, you only need one corresponding reference list entry.</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Examples</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Your writing has in-text citations for the sources Andrews, 2016 and Baker, 2013. Your list of references should have an entry for each of those sources.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Your writing includes a citation from D. Weber, which is information from a personal communication. It shouldn't be included on your list of references because it is a personal communication.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Your writing includes a second citation from Andrews, 2016.  This source is already included on your list of references, so it doesn't need to be added again. </p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>You read the source Maztosi, 2008 but didn't cite it in your writing. This source should not be included on your list of references.</p>
