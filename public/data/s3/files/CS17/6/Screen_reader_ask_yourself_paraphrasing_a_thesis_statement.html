<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Your conclusion should paraphrase your thesis statement.  This means to use different words to restate the same ideas.</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Thesis statement:</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Going to the movies is better than staying home because there are no distractions or interruptions at the movies; the audio and visual experiences are more intense at the movies; and making the effort to get out and go to the movie theater is a more active use of my time.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Start by asking yourself:</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>What is the topic?</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The topic is going to the movies.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Next, ask yourself:</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>What am I trying to say about the topic?</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>You are saying that going to the movies is better than staying at home. You paraphrase this by saying, "A trip to the movies will always be better than staying home and watching TV."</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Next, ask yourself:</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>What reasons have I included?</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>You've included three reasons:</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Reason 1: there are no distractions or interruptions. You paraphrase this by saying, "While watching a film at the theater, you will not be interrupted by advertisements, work, or other distractions in your home."</p> 
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Reason 2: the audio-visual experience is more intense. You paraphrase this by saying, "The audio-visual experience will be superior to what you can experience on your TV."</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Reason 3: making the effort to go out is more active. You paraphrase this by saying, "Remember that the activity of getting out of the house is good for your physical and mental health."</p>

<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>After you use different words to restate these ideas, your paraphrased thesis statement is this:</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>A trip to the movies will always be better than staying home and watching TV.
