<h1 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>How purpose affects your writing</span></h1>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
           color:#000000'>Your purpose for writing can be to share factual information, tell a story, or convince someone of something. This affects how you will present your ideas and what you say.  Here are three paragraphs that show different ways to write about stress.  Each paragraph is written for a different purpose.</p>   
    
    <h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Your purpose is to share factual information; this is a paragraph from a science book.</span></h2>
        <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
          color:#000000'>Notice how the paragraph defines the situation, clearly describes what happens, offers no opinion, and includes scientific information. </p>

      <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
           color:#000000'><b>About stress.</b> The body has several distinct physical reactions to situations that
seem to be threatening or demanding. The heartbeat will
increase, pumping blood at a faster rate. Muscles tighten, ready
to spring into action. Individuals under stress will experience a
heightening of their senses, as the body prepares to meet the
stressful situation. Most people have experienced all these
symptoms at some time in their lives.</p>   
    
     <h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Your purpose is to tell a story; this is a blog entry.</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
          color:#000000'>Notice how the blog entry shares personal information.  It is written in the first person, using the personal pronoun "I" or "my."  It describes events in the order in which they happened and uses transitions words to make the order clear.</p>
    
 <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'> <b>A day I worked to relieve stress.</b> The day of my first job interview was a day I learned how to
control the symptoms of stress. As I waited for the boss to open
the door and invite me in, my heart was pounding and my hands
were shaking. I decided to practice deep breathing techniques,
and managed to calm my racing heart. Next, I focused on my
shaking hands, placing them on my knees and imagining a place
where I am always relaxed, the beach. Finally, I focused on the
reasons I knew I would be good at the new job. I reminded myself
about my computer skills and how hard I work. By the time the
boss opened the door to his office and came out to greet me, I was
smiling and relaxed, ready to succeed.

     <h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>You are convincing someone of something; this is an article in a health newsletter.</span></h2>
    
      <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
           color:#000000'> Notice how the article starts with a statement that some readers may not agree with, includes important information and multiple details as support, and connects the ideas in the article with the readers' own lives.</p>   
  
        <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
            color:#000000'><b>Why you need to reduce stress.</b> Allowing stress to rule your life may result in consequences that
negatively affect your health and productivity. Stress, when not
managed, can contribute to a variety of health issues, from a
reduced immune system to more serious heart disease. Stress
hormones increase the heart rate and may elevate blood
pressure, a condition that, over time, may contribute to adverse
health effects. Individuals under constant stress may have
difficulty controlling their emotions, causing interpersonal
conflicts at work and at home.
