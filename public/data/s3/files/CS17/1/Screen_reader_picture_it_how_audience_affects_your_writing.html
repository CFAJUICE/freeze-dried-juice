<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
           color:#000000'>When you write, your audience may know nothing about your subject, be a group of experts, or may disagree with you.  This affects how you will present your ideas and what you say.  Here are three paragraphs that show different ways to write about stress.  Each paragraph is written for a different audience.</p>   
    
    <h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Your readers don't know anything about the subject; you are writing an article for an exercise magazine.</span></h2>
        <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
          color:#000000'>Notice how the article lets the reader know the importance of the writer's ideas, includes plenty of background information, and presents ideas that will interest the reader. </p>

      <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
           color:#000000'><b>Exercise can reduce stress.</b> We all know that regular physical exercise will improve our health
and appearance, but did you know that exercise can reduce
stress? The next time you feel too overwhelmed with your
responsibilities, remember that taking time out for physical
activity will actually improve your body's reaction to the stressors
in your life. Devoting thirty minutes a day to walking, swimming,
or biking will put the responsibilities into perspective and give
you a feeling of control. When you can add socialization to the
mix by exercising in a class or walking with friends at work, you
increase the benefits even more.

<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
          color:#000000'>Notice how the brochure provides minimum background information, introduces new ideas, and includes accurate details. </p>
    
 <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'><b>The benefits of Laughter Yoga.</b>  While any type of yoga will assist in managing stress, Laughter
Yoga is especially effective. Laughter Yoga, first practiced almost
a hundred years ago, involves practicing traditional yoga while
voluntarily laughing out loud. It is based on the belief that
voluntary laughter (forced laughter) will bring about the same
psychological and physiological benefits as involuntary laughter.
The laughter in this setting does not rely on an intellectual
perception of humor, but rather on the physical act of producing
laughter. Twenty minutes of engagement will produce full
benefits for the participant.

      <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
           color:#000000'> Notice how the blog acknowledges the opposing viewpoint, presents new information, and offers three convincing reasons. </p>   
  
        <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
            color:#000000'><b>The benefits of stress.</b> Many people believe stress is a negative force, but it can actually
help you achieve, contribute to physical fitness, and boost your
confidence. Having some stress in your life keeps you motivated
to get up every day and take on the responsibilities of your life.
Stress, and the ability it brings to help us perform well in
physically demanding situations, is what drives many athletes to
reach great heights. Finally, when you use the energy produced
by stress to overcome fears or obstacles, you feel proud of your
achievement and ready to move forward.
