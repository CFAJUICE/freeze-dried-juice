          <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Design Science MathPlayer&trade;</h3>
     <p class="normal">JUICE uses MathJAX to display mathematical notation.  You must install Design Science's MathPlayer for NVDA to read MathJAX properly.  Download and install MathPlayer for free from this location:</p>

    <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Punctuation and symbol reading</h3>
    
     <p class="normal"> In NVDA Voice settings, set Punctuation/Symbol level to "some." </p>
    
      <h2 id="layout" tabindex="0" class="h2">JUICE Site layout</h2>
    
    <p class="normal"> The JUICE site content is organized into modules.  Each module covers a competency such as writing a 5 paragraph essay or working with decimals, fractions, and percents.   Each module contains a collection of mini-lessons that present  the skills related to the module competency.   </p>
    
       <p class="normal">Mini-lessons present the material in three different formats:  </p>
    
    <ul data-brackets-id="32705">
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">An Overview provides a step-by-step presentation. </li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32707">Try its provide interactive examples.</li>  
                <li data-brackets-id="32708">Mini-games (not yet accessible) allow students to check their understanding. </li>
            </ul> 

 
    <p class="normal"> The JUICE site contains 4 basic pages that give you access to the  module and mini-lesson content:  JUICE Home,  JUICE Search, JUICE Module, and JUICE mini-lesson: </p>
    
    <ul data-brackets-id="32705">
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">    <b>JUICE Home</b> has a tab menu of 3 tabs.  Only the first tab, JUICE Modules, currently supports screen readers.  The JUICE Modules tab gives you access to a list of modules and mini-lessons using a tree menu.</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32707"><b>JUICE Search</b> displays search results organized by module.  It gives you access to a list of modules, mini-lessons, and additional resources using a tree menu.</li>  
                <li data-brackets-id="32708"><b>JUICE Module</b> lists the mini-lessons available for a module and gives you access to them using a tree menu. </li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32708"><b>JUICE Mini-lessons</b> present the Overview, Try its, and mini-games using a tab menu of 3 tabs.</li>
            </ul> 
    
    
      <h2 id="basic" tabindex="0" class="h2">Navigation basics</h2>
    
        <p class="normal"> Use the tab key to navigate through the different areas of the JUICE site unless you are in a tree menu, tab menu, or Try it question.   Review the detailed navigation information below for more details. </p>
    
        <p class="normal"> When you enter the site, you will be at the top of a JUICE page in the page banner.   Your first tab will go to a Skip Navigation link.  Pressing Enter on this link takes you to the page's main content area. </p>
    
        <p class="normal"> If you do not use Skip Navigation, you continue tabbing through links in the site's banner that provide access to JUICE Home, Help, Search, logout, and the site navigation breadcrumb list. </p>
    
     <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Landmarks</h3>
    
        <p class="normal"> Each JUICE page supports these landmarks: </p>
    
     <ul data-brackets-id="32705">
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">    <b>JUICE Banner:</b> Takes you to the top of the page</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32707"><b>Skip navigation:</b> Takes you to the Skip Navigation link</li>  
                <li data-brackets-id="32708"><b>JUICE Home:</b> Takes you to a link that lets you navigate to JUICE Home </li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32708"><b>Search:</b> Takes you to the Search field.  Note:  When you navigate to Search using the Landmark, you must switch to forms mode (NVDA + spacebar)  to type in the search field.</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32708"><b>Main:</b> Takes you to the beginning of the content on the page.</li>
            </ul> 
    
    
    <p class="normal"> In addition, the Overview tab of the JUICE mini-lesson page supports this landmark: </p>
    
    <ul data-brackets-id="32705">
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">    <b>Display all steps button:</b>   This is available after you have worked through the Overview one complete time.  Displays all the steps in the Overview so you do not have to use the Next Step button after each step (see below for more on Overview navigation).</li>
            </ul> 
    
    <p class="normal">Tip:  Click L or Shift + L to navigate from one landmark to the next. </p>
    

     <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Navigating through Tab menus</h3>
    
    <p class="normal"> The JUICE Home page and JUICE mini-lesson page use tab menus. </p>
    
    <p class="normal"> NVDA announces a tab menu as a tab control.   It tells you what tab you are on and how many tabs there are.   </p>
    
        <ul data-brackets-id="32705">
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Use the right or left arrows to navigate through tabs.  </li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32707">Use the tab key to access the contents of a tab.</li>  
            
            </ul> 
    
    
    <p class="normal"> <b>Tip:</b>  If the arrow keys do not navigate the tabs and start spelling out the tab name instead, try using Shift + tab to back one and tab to go forward.  At this point the tab menu should work as expected.  You can also try switching to forms mode (NVDA+ spacebar).
 </p>
    
    
     <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Navigating through Tree menus</h3>
    
    <p class="normal"> The JUICE Home Modules tab, Search, and the JUICE Module page use tree menus. </p>
    <p class="normal"> A tree menu presents a hierarchy of links.  You can navigate through all the links at level 1, or you can expand any level 1 link to access the links underneath it at level 2.  Once a level 1 link is expanded, the level 2 links underneath it become part of the list that you are navigating through until  you collapse it again. </p>
    <p class="normal"> NVDA will announce a tree menu as a tree view.  It will tell you what level of the tree the currently selected  link is, how many there are, and whether the current link is expanded or collapsed.   If it does not announce a link as expanded or collapsed, then there is nothing underneath the link in the hierarchy. </p>
    <p class="normal"> Navigation is as follows: </p>
    
            <ul data-brackets-id="32705">
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Use the down and up arrows to navigate through the list.</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Use the right arrow to expand any collapsed link.</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32707">Use the up and down arrows to navigate through the level 2 list</li>  
                 <li data-brackets-id="32706">Use the left arrow to collapse any expanded link.</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32707">Use the Enter key to click on a link in the menu and navigate to its page</li> 
             <li data-brackets-id="32706">If  you press the left arrow on a level 2 link that cannot be collapsed, it will jump to its level 1 link.</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32707">If you tab out of the tree but don't leave the page, tabbing back into the tree will return you to the link that was selected when you left the tree.</li> 
            </ul> 

<p class="normal"> <b>Tip:</b> You cannot access Landmarks when you are inside a tree menu.  Use Shift + tab to leave the tree menu and then the Landmarks will work.</p>


    
      <h2 id="overview" tabindex="0" class="h2">Mini-lesson Overview</h2>
    
    <p class="normal"> The Overview is presented in steps.  Each step has an audio button that will play a narration of the step content, one or two content areas, and a Next step button.    </p>
    
          <ul data-brackets-id="32705">
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Use the tab key to navigate through the Overview content areas. </li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Use the Enter key on the Next Step button to navigate to the next step.</li> 
                 <li data-brackets-id="32706">Use the Enter key on the "Play or pause audio version of content, toggle button" to start the audio narration and to stop it.</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32707">After you have worked through an entire Overview once, you can choose to Display all steps by pressing Enter when the Display all steps button is selected.   This allows you to tab through all the content without using Next Step button.   The Display all steps button  is a landmark.</li>  
            </ul> 
    
        <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Reading math notation</h3>
    
    <p class="normal">JUICE uses MathJAX for math notation.   NVDA reads MathJAX automatically if you have installed Design Science's MathPlayer.   When you tab to a content area, NVDA reads the MathJAX math where it occurs in the text and announces it as "math."  When you tab to leave the content area, NVDA selects each MathJAX object again and re-reads it. Keep tabbing and when you have selected the last MathJAX object, the next tab will go to any links that are in the current content area, or to the next content area.</p>
  
     <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Screen reader only annotations</h3>
    
    <p class="normal"> In some cases, JUICE uses highlighting or other types of visual treatment as part of the presentation.   Steps with this type of treatment include "screen reader only" text that is not visible to the sighted user but is read by the screen reader.   This text explains the points being made by the visual part of the presentation.</p>
    
    <p class="normal"> <b>Tip:</b>   If you are using a screen reader and also looking at the text on screen, the screen reader will sometimes seem to be reading text that isn't there.   It will be reading the "screen reader only" text that is hidden from the visual display.</p>
    
     <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Images, Picture its, and supplementary resource documents</h3>
    
    <p class="normal">Most images in JUICE have complete descriptions included as alt text.  However, some images require very lengthy descriptions that are not appropriate for alt text.  These images are followed  by a "view as text" link that opens an html text description of the image in a new window.</p>
    
     <p class="normal"> JUICE includes links to visual resources called "Picture its."   These are either html documents with images, or pdf files that open in a new window.  The html documents with images are accessible, but the others generally are not.  If a Picture it is not accessible, JUICE provides a link to a screen reader version of it immediately following the Picture it link.  The screen reader version link is read by a screen reader but is hidden from sighted users. The screen reader version of the Picture it is a text description that opens in a new tab.   For sighted users, the availability of a screen reader version link is indicated by an accessibility icon: <img src="../common_images/accessible_icon.png" alt="screen reader resource, opens in a new window">.  </p>
    
     <p class="normal"> If a Picture it does not have a screen reader version, give it a try!   It should be accessible on its own.</p>
     <p class="normal">JUICE also has links to supplementary documents.  These are generally formatted as pdfs and should be readable if you download them and open them in a pdf reader.</p>
    
      <h2 id="tryit" tabindex="0" class="h2">Mini-lesson Try it</h2>
    
    <p class="normal"> Basic navigation within a Try it is the same as it is for the Overview.   There are a few additional features. </p>
    
     <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Try it Information Box</h3>
    
    <p class="normal"> Many Try its require you to use information that is presented at the beginning of the Try it to answer questions later on.   For sighted users, this information is presented in a box that appears to the right of the step contents next to the questions.   </p>
   
    <p class="normal">JUICE does not support tabbing to this supplemental information box.  Instead, screen reader users can access this information by typing Alt + 1.   The Try it Information Box will open in a new window.   You can use Alt + tab to navigate back and forth between the Try it Information Box and the main Try it.  </p>
    
      <p class="normal"> Note:  If the Try it information box does not display, you may need to allow pop-ups from JUICE.  </p>
    
     <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Try it question navigation</h3>
    
         <h4 tabindex="0" class="h4">Multiple choice interactive question</h4>
    
              <ul data-brackets-id="32705">
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Tab key to get to the first answer choice </li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Up and down arrow keys to select answer choices and move up and down in the list.</li> 
                 <li data-brackets-id="32706">Tab key to get to the check answer button from anywhere in the list</li>  
            </ul> 
    
    <h4 tabindex="0" class="h4">Multiple selection interactive question</h4>
    
   <ul data-brackets-id="32705">
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Tab key to get to the first answer choice</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Tab key to move up and down in the list</li> 
                 <li data-brackets-id="32706">Spacebar to make a selection</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">At the end of the list, tab key to get to the check answer button.  You can only get to the check answer button from the end of the list</li> 
            </ul> 
    
    <h4 tabindex="0" class="h4">Click to select menu </h4>
    
  <ul data-brackets-id="32705">
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Tab key to get to the fill in menu</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Enter to open the menu and see the answer choices</li> 
                 <li data-brackets-id="32706">Up and down arrow keys to move up and down in the list</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">Enter to make a selection</li> 
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">Tab key to get to the check answer button after you have made a selection</li> 
            </ul> 
    

    <h4 tabindex="0" class="h4">Edit field</h4>
    
  <ul data-brackets-id="32705">
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Tab key to get to the edit field</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Type your answer</li> 
                 <li data-brackets-id="32706">Tab key to get to the check answer button.</li>
            </ul> 

    
          <p class="normal"> <b>Tip:</b>  In math content, some short answer questions will have formatting instructions following the edit field.  It is a good practice to listen to the entire question content area before answering a question.
</p>
    
     <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Steps with multiple questions</h3>
    
    <p class="normal"> Some content areas have more than one question.  In this case, listen to the entire content area and its questions first.  </p>
    
    <p class="normal"> Then, use Shift + tab to go back to the previous content area, and tab to return to the content area with the questions.  Start answering the questions in order.</p>
    
    <p class="normal"> Each time you tab from feedback, you return to the beginning of the question content area.  </p>
    
    <p class="normal"> You can tab from one question input to the next, but if the question requires surrounding text to give it context, you will need to listen to the content area from the beginning. </p>
    
     <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Check answer button and feedback</h3>
    
    <p class="normal"> After you answer a question, your next tab goes to a Check answer button.  Press Enter when this button is selected to evaluate your answer. </p>
    
    <p class="normal"> JUICE gives a feedback message for an incorrect or correct answer.  Tabbing from the feedback takes you back to the beginning of the content area with the question in it and gives you the opportunity to try again if necessary. </p>
    
    <p class="normal"> If you can't answer correctly within a few tries, JUICE will provide the correct answer.
</p>
    
     <p class="normal"> The Next step button is not available in a step until you have completed the questions in the step.   </p>
    
    <p class="normal"> <b>Tip:</b>  If you accidentally tab out of the step to the top of the browser, use Shift + tab to get back again.
