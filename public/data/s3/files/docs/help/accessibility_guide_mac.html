    <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Punctuation and symbol reading</h3>
    
     <p class="normal"> In VoiceOver utility settings, select "Verbosity," then the "Text" tab, and set Punctuation/Symbol level to "some." </p>
    
    <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Enable Tab key navigation in Safari</h3>
    
     <p class="normal"> Open Safari preferences and click on the "Advanced" icon.  Check the box next to "Press tab to highlight each item on a webpage." </p>
    
      <h2 id="layout" tabindex="0" class="h2">JUICE Site layout</h2>
    
    <p class="normal"> The JUICE site content is organized into modules.  Each module covers a competency such as writing a 5 paragraph essay or working with decimals, fractions, and percents.   Each module contains a collection of mini-lessons that present skills you may want to review and practice.   </p>
    
       <p class="normal">Mini-lessons present the material in three different formats:  </p>
    
    <ul data-brackets-id="32705">
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">An Overview provides a step-by-step presentation. </li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32707">Try its provide interactive tutorials with questions.</li>  
                <li data-brackets-id="32708">Mini-games (not yet accessible) provide a quick, low-stakes way to practice skills. </li>
            </ul> 

 
    <p class="normal"> The JUICE site contains 4 main types of pages that give you access to the  module and mini-lesson content:  the JUICE Home page,  JUICE Search page, JUICE Module pages, and JUICE mini-lesson pages: </p>
    
    <ul data-brackets-id="32705">
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">    <b>JUICE Home</b> has a tabbed menu of 3 tabs.  Only the first tab, JUICE Modules, currently supports screen readers.  This page lists all available modules and mini-lessons using a tree menu.</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32707"><b>JUICE Search</b> allows you to enter a query, then displays search results organized by module.  It gives you access to a list of modules, mini-lessons, and additional resources using a tree menu.</li>  
                <li data-brackets-id="32708">A <b>JUICE Module</b> page lists all the mini-lessons available for a set of related skills, such as skills for writing an essay, and gives you access to them using a tree menu. </li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32708"><b>JUICE Mini-lessons</b> present the Overview, Try its, and Challenge Games using a tabbed menu of 3 tabs.</li>
            </ul> 
    
    
      <h2 id="basic" tabindex="0" class="h2">Navigation basics</h2>
    
        <p class="normal"> IMPORTANT!  We recommend using the Tab key to navigate the top of JUICE pages, instead of the VO + Arrow Keys, because tabbing will skip images and other visual elements that cannot be interacted with and take you directly to the clickable objects and fillable fields. </p>
    
        <p class="normal"> When you enter the site, you will be at the top of a JUICE page in the page banner.   Your first tab will go to a Skip Navigation link.  Pressing Return on this link takes you to the page's main content area. </p>
    
        <p class="normal"> If you do not use Skip Navigation, you continue tabbing through links in the site's banner to go to JUICE Home, Help, Search, logout, and the site navigation breadcrumb list. </p>
    
     <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Landmarks</h3>
    
    <p class="normal">Tip:  Use VO + U to open the VoiceOver rotor menu.  Then, use the Arrow keys to access the list of available landmarks. </p>
    
        <p class="normal"> Each JUICE page supports these landmarks: </p>
    
     <ul data-brackets-id="32705">
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">    <b>JUICE Banner:</b> Takes you to the top of the page</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32707"><b>Skip navigation:</b> Takes you to the Skip Navigation link</li>  
                <li data-brackets-id="32708"><b>JUICE Home:</b> Takes you to a link that lets you navigate to JUICE Home </li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32708"><b>Search:</b> Takes you to the Search field</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32708"><b>Main:</b> Takes you to the beginning of the content on the page</li>
            </ul> 
    
    
    <p class="normal"> In addition, the Overview tab of the JUICE mini-lesson page supports this landmark: </p>
    
    <ul data-brackets-id="32705">
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">    <b>Display all steps button:</b>   This is available after you have worked through the Overview one complete time.  Displays all the steps in the Overview so you do not have to use the Next Step button after each step (see below for more on Overview navigation).</li>
            </ul> 
    
     <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Navigating through Tab menus</h3>
    
    <p class="normal"> The JUICE Home page and JUICE mini-lesson page use tab menus. </p>
    
    <p class="normal"> VoiceOver announces a tab as selected.   It tells you the name of the tab you are on and how many tabs there are.   </p>
    
        <ul data-brackets-id="32705">
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Use the Right or Left Arrow keys to navigate through tabs.  VO + Right or Left Arrow keys can also be used.</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32707">Use the Tab key to access the contents of a tab.</li>  
            
            </ul> 
    
    <p class="normal"> <b>Tip:</b> The tabs on the JUICE home page will open as you navigate to with the Arrow keys.  The tabs on JUICE mini-lesson pages do not currently do this.  Use the Arrow keys to move the VoiceOver cursor to the tab you want to select, then press the Return key. This selects the tab and opens its contents.  From there you can use the Tab key to access the contents of the tab.  VoiceOver tells you if a tab is open by announcing the tab's name and saying "selected."  If the tab is not open, VoiceOver only reads the name of the tab.</p>
    
    
     <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Navigating through Tree menus</h3>
    
    <p class="normal"> The JUICE Home Modules tab, Search, and the JUICE Module page use tree menus. </p>
    <p class="normal"> A tree menu presents a hierarchy of links.  You can navigate through all the links at level 1, or you can expand any level 1 link to access the links underneath it at level 2.  Once a level 1 link is expanded, the level 2 links underneath it become part of the list that you are navigating through until  you collapse it again. </p>
    <p class="normal"> VoiceOver will announce a tree menu as a collapsed or expanded group.  If VoiceOver announces a group as collapsed and the button combination to expand it doesn't do anything, then there is nothing underneath the link in the hierarchy. </p>
    <p class="normal"> Navigation is as follows: </p>
    
            <ul data-brackets-id="32705">
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Use the Command + Down and Up arrow keys to navigate through the tree menu's list of links.</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Command + Right arrow expands a collapsed group.</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32706"> Command + Left arrow collapses an expanded group.  Pressing Command + Left arrow on a level 2 group that cannot be collapsed will not do anything, and the VoiceOver cursor will remain in place.</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32707"> After a link is expanded to show links underneath it, the Command + Down and Up arrows navigate through the expanded list.</li>   
                <li data-brackets-id="32707">  Use the Return key to select a link in the menu and navigate to its page.</li> 
                <li data-brackets-id="32707">Pressing the Tab key leaves the tree.  If you tab back to the tree after leaving it (Shift + Tab), you will return to the previously selected link in the tree.</li> 
            </ul> 


 <h2 id="overview" tabindex="0" class="h2">Navigating the Overview Part of a Mini-lesson</h2>
    
    <p class="normal"> The Overview is presented in steps.  Each step has an audio button that will play narration of the step content, one or two content areas, and a Next Step button.    </p>
    
          <ul data-brackets-id="32705">
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Use the Tab key to navigate through the Overview content areas. </li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Use the Return key on the Next Step button to navigate to the next step.</li>
                <li>Use the VO + Arrow keys to navigate tables within content areas.</li>
                 <li data-brackets-id="32706">Use the Return key on the "Play or pause audio version of content, toggle button" to start the audio narration and to stop it.</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32707">After you have worked through an entire Overview once, you can choose to Display all steps by pressing Return when the Display all steps button is selected.   This allows you to tab through all the content without using the Next Step button.   The Display all steps button  is a landmark.</li>
              <li>You can also use the standard VO + Left and Right arrow keys to navigate through the content areas.</li>
            </ul> 
    
        <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Reading mathematical notation</h3>
    
    <p class="normal">JUICE uses MathJAX for math notation.   VoiceOver reads MathJAX automatically.   When you tab to a content area, VoiceOver reads the MathJAX math where it occurs in the text.  For MathJAX fractions, VoiceOver announces "fraction start," reads the numerator and denominator (example: 2 over 3), then announces "end of fraction."  VoiceOver does not announce other math objects before reading them.  When you tab to leave the content area, VoiceOver selects each MathJAX object again and re-reads it. Keep tabbing, and when you have selected the last MathJAX object, the next tab will go to any links that are in the current content area, or to the next content area.</p>
  
     <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Screen reader only annotations</h3>
    
    <p class="normal"> In some cases, JUICE uses highlighting or other types of visual treatment as part of the presentation.   Steps with this type of treatment include "screen reader only" text that is not visible to the sighted user but is read by the screen reader.   This text explains the points being made by the visual part of the presentation.</p>
    
    <p class="normal"> <b>Tip:</b>   If you are looking at the text while listening to the screenreader, you'll notice places where the screenreader reads text that isn't there.  It is reading the "screen reader only" text that is hidden from the visual display.</p>
    
     <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Images, Picture its, and supplementary resource documents</h3>
    
    <p class="normal">Most images in JUICE have complete descriptions included as alt text.  However, some images require very lengthy descriptions that are not appropriate for alt text.  These images are followed  by a "view as text" link that opens an HTML text description of the image in a new window.</p>
    
     <p class="normal"> JUICE mini-lessons include links to visual resources called "Picture its."   Picture its open in a new window and are either HTML documents with images or pdf files.  The HTML documents with images are accessible, but the others generally are not.  If a Picture it is not accessible, JUICE provides a link to a screen reader version of it immediately following the Picture it link.  The screen reader version link is read by a screen reader but is hidden from sighted users. The screen reader version of the Picture it is a text description that opens in a new tab.   For sighted users, the availability of a screen reader version link is indicated by an accessibility icon: <img src="../common_images/accessible_icon.png" alt="screen reader resource, opens in a new window">.  </p>
    
     <p class="normal"> If a Picture it does not have a screen reader version, give it a try!   It should be accessible on its own.</p>
     <p class="normal">JUICE also has links to supplementary documents.  These are generally formatted as PDFs and should be readable if you download them and open them in a pdf reader.</p>
    
      <h2 id="tryit" tabindex="0" class="h2">Navigating the Try it part of a Mini-lesson</h2>
    
    <p class="normal"> Basic navigation within a Try it is the same as it is for the Overview.   There are a few additional features. </p>
    
     <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Try it Information Box</h3>
    
    <p class="normal"> Many Try its require you to use information that is presented at the beginning of the Try it to answer questions later on.   For sighted users, this information is presented in a box that appears to the right of the step contents next to the questions.   </p>
   
    <p class="normal">JUICE does not support tabbing to this supplemental information box.  Instead, screen reader users can access this information by typing Option + 1.   The Try it Information Box will open in a new window.   You can use Command + Tilde (~) to navigate back and forth between the Try it Information Box and the main Try it.  </p>
    
      <p class="normal"> Note:  If the Try it information box does not display, you may need to allow pop-ups from JUICE.  </p>
    
     <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Try it question navigation</h3>
    
     <p class="normal"> Try its have four types of questions: Multiple choice, multiple selection, click to select (fill-in-the-blank), and edit text (short answer).  Navigate these as follows.</p>
    
         <h4 tabindex="0" class="h4">Multiple choice interactive question</h4>
    
            <p>In multiple choice questions, there is one correct answer. You select your answer, then check answer. Each time you check your answer, you get feedback, including tips.</p>
    
              <ul data-brackets-id="32705">
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Tab key or VO + Right Arrow to enter the group with the question and answer options</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  VO + Right and Left arrow keys (Right arrow key moves the cursor down the list, Left arrow key moves the cursor up) to select answer choices and move up and down in the list.</li> 
                 <li data-brackets-id="32706">Tab key to get to the check answer button from anywhere in the list (VO + Arrow keys will also bring you to the check answer button, after going through the list of answer options)</li>  
            </ul> 
    
    <h4 tabindex="0" class="h4">Multiple selection interactive question</h4>
    
    <p class="normal">Some questions have more than one correct answer. Select all you think are correct and check your answer. Each time you check your answer, you get feedback, including tips.</p>
    
   <ul data-brackets-id="32705">
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Tab key or VO + Right Arrow to get to the group of answer options</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Tab key to select the first answer on the list</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  VO + Right and Left arrow keys to move up and down in the list</li> 
                 <li data-brackets-id="32706">Spacebar to mark a selection</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">Tab key to get to the check answer button from anywhere in the list</li> 
            </ul> 
    
    <h4 tabindex="0" class="h4">Click to select question (fill-in-the-blank)</h4>
    
        <p class="normal">Some questions have you select an answer from a drop-down menu of answer options. Select the answer you think is correct and check your answer. Each time you check your answer, you get feedback, including tips.</p>
    
  <ul data-brackets-id="32705">
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Tab key to select and hear the whole group of text read, including the "Click to select" menus that are in the text</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Alternately, use VO + Right arrow to select and hear one sentence of text at a time (Oder: Sentence of text, followed by "Click to select" menu, then corresponding check answer button, then the next sentence)</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Tab key to get to the fill-in menu</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Return to open the menu and see the answer choices</li> 
                 <li data-brackets-id="32706">VO + Right and Left arrow keys to move up and down in the list (Right arrow moves the cursor down, Left arrow moves the cursor up)</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">Return to make a selection</li> 
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">Tab key or VO + Right arrow to get to the check answer button after you have made a selection</li> 
            </ul> 
    

    <h4 tabindex="0" class="h4">Edit text question (short answer)</h4>
    
        <p class="normal">Some questions have you type a short answer into a text field. Type in your answer and check it. Each time you check your answer, you get feedback, including tips.</p>
    
  <ul data-brackets-id="32705">
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Tab key or VO + Right arrow to get to the edit field</li>
                <li data-brackets-id="32706">  Type your answer</li> 
                 <li data-brackets-id="32706">Tab key to get to the check answer button.</li>
            </ul> 

    
          <p class="normal"> <b>Tip:</b>  In math content, some short answer questions will have formatting instructions following the edit field.  It is a good practice to listen to the entire question content area before answering a question.
</p>
    
     <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Steps with multiple questions</h3>
    
    <p class="normal"> Some content areas have more than one question.  In this case, listen to the entire content area and its questions first.  </p>
    
    <p class="normal"><b>Note:</b> There is a known oddity where VoiceOver will read each answer option twice.</p>
    
    <p class="normal"> Use the Tab key to select the first answer option. Then, use the Left and Right arrow keys to navigate through the answer options (Right arrow moves the cursor down, Left arrow moves the cursor up). Start answering the questions in order.</p>
    
    <p class="normal"><b>Note:</b> Avoid using VO + Arrow keys to navigate between the answer options.  Doing so will cause the VoiceOver cursor to select and read the radio button and the text next to the radio button separately, causing the answer to be read twice.</p>
    
    <p class="normal"> Each time you tab from feedback, you return to the beginning of the question content area.  </p>
    
    <p class="normal"> You can tab from one question input to the next, but if the question requires surrounding text to give it context, you will need to listen to the content area from the beginning. </p>
    
     <h3 tabindex="0" class="h3">Check answer button and feedback</h3>
    
    <p class="normal"> After you answer a question, your next tab goes to a Check answer button.  Press Return when this button is selected to evaluate your answer. </p>
    
    <p class="normal"> JUICE gives a feedback message for an incorrect or correct answer.  Tabbing from the feedback takes you back to the beginning of the content area with the question in it and gives you the opportunity to try again if necessary. </p>
    
    <p class="normal"> If you can't answer correctly within a few tries, JUICE will provide the correct answer.
</p>
    
     <p class="normal"> The Next step button is not available in a step until you have completed the questions in the step.   </p>
    
    <p class="normal"> <b>Tip:</b>  If you accidentally tab out of the step to the top of the browser, use Shift + tab to get back again.
