        <p data-brackets-id="32680">
            
         Welcome to JUICE interactive and personalized skill-building resources. JUICE was funded by a U.S. Department of Education grant and is available to students at partnering academic institutions. JUICE gives you a choice of different ways to review and practice important academic skills while you are working on college projects and assignments. “JUICE” stands for 
            “<u data-brackets-id="32681">ju</u>st-<u data-brackets-id="32682">i</u>n-time, <u data-brackets-id="32683">c</u>ontextualized, and <u data-brackets-id="32684">e</u>mpowering” academic support.   
        </p>
    
        <p data-brackets-id="32685">
            Your online course may link directly to a specific JUICE skill-building module or link to the JUICE Home page where you can browse or search for help on different kinds of skills, including writing, mathematics, and others. Each JUICE module supports a group of related skills and helps you find the specific skill you need to review. For example, there's a JUICE module on how to write an essay in which each  mini-lesson focuses on one skill, such as how to write a good thesis statement. 
        </p>
            
        <p>
            JUICE always uses real-world situations to help you review, practice and, remember how to apply skills.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            From a JUICE module page, start with the page tour, then explore mini-lessons on different skills, or play the Challenge Wheel game to find out what you need to review.
        </p>
