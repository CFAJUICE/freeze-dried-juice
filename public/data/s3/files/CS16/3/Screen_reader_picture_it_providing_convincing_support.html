<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
           color:#000000'>When you plan a paragraph, think about your paragraph's topic and main idea, and the supporting details you want to include. The details should be convincing, relevant, and support your topic and main idea.   Suppose you are writing a paragraph about baby sitting.  Your topic and main idea is that babysitting is a great job for a young teenager.   Which of these details would be a good choice for your paragraph?</p>   
    
    <h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Possible supporting details</span></h2>
      <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
           color:#000000'>Detail 1.  Babysitters do not need a driver's license as they are
usually picked up and driven home by a family member.  This detail provides a good reason that babysitting is a great job for a teenager and you can include it in your paragraph.</p>   
    
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Detail 2.  The hours when babysitters are in demand usually fall on
weekends, when high school kids are not in school. This is a relevant and convincing detail and can also be included in your paragraph.</p>
 
      <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
           color:#000000'> Detail 3.  I think babysitting is fun for teenagers.   This detail is presenting your own opinion.  Your own opinion is not convincing and should not be included in your paragraph.</p>   
  
    <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
            color:#000000'> Detail 4.  The number of licensed full time day care centers
increased dramatically in 2015.    This is not a relevant detail, since teenagers are interested in part-time work, and this is about full-time work. It should not be included in your paragraph.  </p>
        <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
            color:#000000'>Detail 5.  As a babysitter, you can earn some money each week that
you can choose to spend or save.  This is a relevant and convincing detail and you can include it in your paragraph. </p>

            color:#000000'> Detail 6.  A lot of teenagers also work in the fast food industry.  This is not relevant to your topic, which is babysitting, and should not be included in your paragraph. </p>
      <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
            color:#000000'>Detail 7.  Babysitting jobs do not require you to have a fixed schedule,
allowing you to work when your schedule allows. This is a relevant and convincing detail and you can include it in your paragraph.</p>

color:#000000'>Flexibility and the opportunity to generate income make babysitting a great job for a young teenager. Babysitters do not need a
driver's license as they are usually picked up and driven home by a family
member. The hours that babysitters are in demand usually fall on weekends,
when high school students are free. As a babysitter, you can earn some money
each week that you can choose to spend or save. Best of all, babysitting jobs do
not require you to commit to a fixed schedule, allowing you to work when it is
convenient for you. </p>
