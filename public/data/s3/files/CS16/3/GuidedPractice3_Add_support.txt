night.&nbsp; The TV in our room was not working correctly, leaving us with nothing to do in the torrential rainstorm. &nbsp;When we called to complain, no one was available to speak with us.&nbsp; When we did speak with someone, he was rude and unhelpful.&nbsp; He told us, &quot;Why don&#39;t you fix the TV yourselves?&quot;&nbsp; The night I spent at the Gravel Mountain Motel was the most
