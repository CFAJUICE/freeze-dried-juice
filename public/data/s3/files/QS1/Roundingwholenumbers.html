      <p><img src="Roundingwholenumbers_image.png" alt="When you round to the nearest whole number, your answer should not have any digits to the right of the decimal point.  Check the digit to the right of the decimal point.  If it is less than 5, round down by removing all of the digits to the right of the decimal point.  If it is greater than or equal to 5, round up by adding 1 to the digit to the left of the decimal point and removing all of the digits to its right.  Suppose you are rounding the number 167.34182 to the nearest whole number.   The digit to the right of the decimal point is 3.  Since 3 is less than 5, you round down by removing the digits to the right of the decimal point.  Your answer will be 167.   Suppose you are rounding the number 167.94182 to the nearest whole number.  The digit to the right of the decimal point is 9.  Since 9 is greater than or equal to 5, round up by adding 1 to the digit to the left of the decimal point, which is 7, and removing the digits to the right of the decimal point.  Your answer will be 168." style="width:811px;height:431px;">
