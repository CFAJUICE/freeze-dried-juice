color:#552656'>Formatting the list of references</span></h1>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Imagine that you have written an essay that includes information from five different sources.  Three of your reference list entries start with the last names of the authors: Andrews, Bailey, and Ricci.  The other two entries do not have authors, so they start with the titles of the works: Pony Express basic facts, and The recipe that changed the world.  Below is a description of how your list of references should be formatted according to the APA guidelines.</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>APA formatting requirements for the list of references</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Your list of references starts on a separate page at the end of your writing.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The title of the page is References. It is capitalized and centered on the page.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
          color:#000000'>The reference list is alphabetized based on the first letter of each entry, ignoring <i>a</i>, <i>and</i>, and <i>the</i>.</p> <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The first entry on your list of references is the entry for Andrews.   The complete entry is Andrews, J. (2016). <i>Cowboys, cactus, and craziness</i>. San Francisco, CA: West Bay Press.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next entry is the entry for Bailey.  The list of references is double-spaced with no extra space between entries, so there is an empty line between the entry for Andrews and the entry for Bailey, which is caused by the double-spacing. <br>
    The entry for Bailey is long, so it is formatted with a hanging indent of one-half inch, which means that after the first line of the entry, all other lines are indented. </p>
    <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The entry for Bailey begins: Bailey, P. (2013). History of the Pony Express. <i>US News, 11</i>(1), 1-5 retrieved from. The entry continues on the next line which is indented one-half inch: http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2013/11/04/history-of-pony express.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Since the list of references is double-spaced, there is an empty line between the first and second lines of the entry for Bailey.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next entry on the list is for Pony Express basic facts.  <br>
    URLs are kept on one line if possible, so this entry begins with Pony Express basic facts. (2016). Retrieved from. The URL can't fit on the same line, so it is moved down to the second line of the entry and indented.<br>
    The complete reference list entry is: Pony Express basic facts. (2016). Retrieved from, line break, hanging indent, http://www.ponyexpressproject.org/learn-more/.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The final two entries are for Ricci, and The recipe that changed the world.  When you alphabetize the list, <i>The</i> in The recipe that changed the world is ignored, so the entry for The recipe that changed the world comes before the entry for Ricci.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>In each entry with a URL, the hyperlinks are removed from the URLs.</p>   
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Your list of references includes an entry for each in-text citation in your essay except for personal communications.</p>
