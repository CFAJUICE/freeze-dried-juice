<h1 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>More than one citation in a piece of writing</span></h1>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>If you are including information from different authors or sources, then the citation rules apply to each author or source.   The following two paragraphs use information from three different sources.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The first paragraph begins with your own idea: The life of a Pony Express rider was both dangerous and strenuous, and working together to avoid danger was critical.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The second sentence begins with a signal phrase with a date introducing a paraphrase from Andrews: According to Andrews (2016), the communication system between riders was of key importance, providing information about weather, terrain, and other threats.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next sentence has a second use of a signal phrase for Andrews. The date is not required: Andrews tells us that "Riders exchanged advice or warnings about the trail that they had just covered" (p. 35).</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The last sentence of the paragraph begins with your own idea and ends with a direct quotation from Baker that includes a citation: Riders faced natural hazards as well, "sometimes traveling through dust storms, thunderstorms, and snow" (Baker, 2013, p.2).</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The citation pattern starts over with a new paragraph. The second paragraph begins with your own idea: The compensation that the riders received did not match the dangers and rigors of the job.</p> 
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The second sentence begins with a signal phrase for Andrews, including a date because this is a new paragraph: Andrews (2016) notes that the riders who served as part of the Pony Express were paid very little for their services.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next sentence is a paraphrase from the source "Pony Express Basic Facts" and includes a citation: In addition, the difficult nature of the work contributed to a high dropout rate, with many riders only spending a few weeks in employment ("Pony Express Basic Facts," 2016).</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next sentence is your own idea: Some riders did stay with the Pony Express, and their experience helped them transition into government jobs.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next sentence is a paraphrase from Andrews and includes a citation: When the Pony Express suspended operations at the start of the Civil War, many of the riders who were still with the service went to work for the post office (Andrews, 2016).</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The last sentence is your own idea: In fact, Uncle Frank eventually became post-master general for St. Louis.</p>
