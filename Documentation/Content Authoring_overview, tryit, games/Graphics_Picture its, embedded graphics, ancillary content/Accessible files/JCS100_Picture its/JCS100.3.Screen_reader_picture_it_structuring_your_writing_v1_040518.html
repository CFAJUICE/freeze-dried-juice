<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>When you write, it is important to balance your own ideas with the ideas and words of others that you will use as support. Here is one way to structure your writing:</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Think about your topic and read what others have said about it.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Begin with a statement that tells what you believe.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Insert a paraphrase, summary, or direct quotation from a source that confirms, proves, or explains your belief.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Explain the importance of the source material.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Explain the connection between your belief and the source material.</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Example from your family history</span></h2>  
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The paragraph begins with a statement that tells what you believe: Uncle Hiram was right! Ants can be controlled by drawing a chalk line!</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next sentences are a direct quotation from an expert that confirms your belief: As Edgar Smith (2012) explains in his book, <i>Pesky Pests</i>, "When ants are on the move, they create a pheromone trail for other ants to follow. Drawing the chalk line breaks up the pheromones, dispersing the army of ants from their march" (p. 21).</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next sentence states the importance of the source material: Uncle Hiram watched ants engage in this behavior but never knew what caused the behavior.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The last sentences make a connection between your belief and the source: Uncle Hiram proved for me that there is a high level of accuracy in old family tricks that have been passed down from one generation to the next. Individuals may not always be aware of the "why" things work, but they certainly understand "how" things work!</p>
