This includes 300 phone minutes, 300 text messages, and 3 gigabytes of data. Additional costs are  $0.35 for each additional minute, $0.05 for each additional text and $12 for each additional gigabyte.   </p>   
    
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Each month you talk on the phone for 400 minutes, send 500 text messages, and use 4 gigabytes of data.  If you currently pay $119.99 per month, could you save money on this plan?</p>

    Base cost = $39.33 per month<br>
          Included in the plan is:  300 minutes, 300 texts, 3 gigabytes of data<br>
          Additional costs are: $0.35 per minute, $0.05 per text and $12 per gigabyte of data<br>

   Total cost = Base Cost + Cost of Minutes more than 300 + Cost of Texts more than 300 + Cost of Data more than 3<br>
    Base Cost is 39.99.  Cost of Minutes more than 300 is 0.035 times M.  Cost of Texts more than 300 is 0.05 times T.  Cost of Data more than 3 gigabytes is 12 times D.  <br>

            M = your usage minus 300 which equals 400 minus 300 = 100<br>
T =   your usage minus 300 which equals 500 minus 300 = 200<br>
D =  your usage minus 3 which equals 4 minus 3 = 1<br></p>
