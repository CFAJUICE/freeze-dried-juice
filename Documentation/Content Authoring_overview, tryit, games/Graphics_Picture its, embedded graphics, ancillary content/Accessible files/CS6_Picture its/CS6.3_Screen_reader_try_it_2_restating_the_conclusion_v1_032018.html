<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif; color:#000000'>Read the conclusion and decide what the author's key ideas are.</p>
    
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif; color:#000000'>As a die-hard fanatic, I am cautiously optimistic.  Baseball continues to gain increased popularity worldwide and deserves a spot in the Olympics lineup.  The good news is that it looks like the sport has been given the green light to compete in Tokyo in 2020.  But, given the history of the twists and turns of the past decade, the reality is that baseball and softball could be dropped from the lineup again, simply on the whims of Olympic Committee members.  We need to stand more united than ever as baseball fans around the world ready to "hit one out of the park" and win Olympic status for the sport we love, a sport with broad appeal for kids and adults of every age, gender, and culture.  Go for baseball and softball gold, America!  </p>

               <li>The stage is set for baseball to be reinstated as part of the 2020 Summer Olympics.</li>
                <li>The Olympic Committee may decide against including baseball in the 2020 Summer Olympics.
</li>
               <li>Fans of baseball need to stick together and do everything they can 
to bring baseball to the 2020 Summer Olympics.

        <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
          color:#000000'>To restate the author's ideas, you need to mention the potential for baseball to return to the 2020 Summer Olympics, the possibility that it may not return, and the idea that fans of baseball need to do what they can to bring baseball back. </p>
     <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
          color:#000000'>One restatement would be: "Fans need to stand together to help overcome the obstacles to bringing baseball and softball back to the Olympics and make the dream of Tokyo 2020 a reality."</p>

     <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
          color:#000000'>Another restatement would be: "The author recognizes that there are still some obstacles to bringing baseball and softball to the summer Olympics, but she remains hopeful.  The author wants readers to support the global effort by fans to bring baseball and softball back to the Olympics."</p>


 <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
           color:#000000'>Both restatements are correct.  Different readers will explain the conclusion in different ways.
