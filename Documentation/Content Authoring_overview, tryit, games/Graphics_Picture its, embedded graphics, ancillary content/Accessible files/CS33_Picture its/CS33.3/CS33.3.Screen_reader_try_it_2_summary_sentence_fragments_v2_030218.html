<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>There are two ways to fix a sentence fragment. You can write something new to add what the fragment is missing, or you can add the fragment to a complete sentence in your writing.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>You're reviewing an essay you wrote and realize one paragraph has some sentence fragments.</p>

<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The snow leopard is a magnificent creature. Lives in the mountains of Central Asia. Its coat allows it to blend in. Snowy environment. The population is dropping. Because people hunt the snow leopard for its use in traditional Asian medicine. Humans are also encroaching on the snow leopard's habitat. Killing snow leopards that threaten their livestock.</p>

<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The first sentence, "The snow leopard is a magnificent creature," has a subject and a verb and is a complete sentence. However, the next sentence "Lives in the mountains of Central Asia," is a fragment because it is missing a subject. You add the fragment to the complete sentence by removing the period after "The snow leopard is a magnificent creature," adding the word "that" between the clauses and making "lives" lowercase. Now the sentence is, "The snow leopard is a magnificent creature that lives in the mountains of Central Asia."</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The third sentence, "Its coat allows it to blend in," has a subject and a verb and is a complete sentence.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The fourth sentence, "Snowy environment," is a fragment because it is missing a verb. You remove the period, make "snowy" lowercase, and write something new to say what the snowy environment does. Now the sentence is, "The snowy environment provides camouflage."</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The fifth sentence, "The population is dropping," has a subject and a verb and is a complete sentence. However, the next sentence "Because people hunt the snow leopard for its use in traditional Asian medicine," is a fragment because it is a dependent clause without an independent clause to complete the idea. You add the fragment to the complete sentence by removing the period after "The population is dropping," and making "because" lowercase. Now the sentence is, "The population is dropping because people hunt the snow leopard for its use in traditional Asian medicine."</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next sentence, "Humans are also encroaching on the snow leopard's habitat," has a subject and a verb and is a complete sentence.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The last sentence, "Killing snow leopards that threaten their livestock," is a fragment because it is missing a subject. You make "killing" lowercase and write something new to make it a complete sentence. Now the sentence is, "Farmers are killing snow leopards that threaten their livestock."</p>

<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>You fixed all of the sentence fragments! Now the paragraph is, "The snow leopard is a magnificent creature that lives in the mountains of Central Asia. Its coat allows it to blend in. The snowy environment provides camouflage. The population is dropping because people hunt the snow leopard for its uses in traditional Asian medicine. Humans are also encroaching on the snow leopard's habitat. Farmers are killing snow leopards that threaten their livestock." </p>
