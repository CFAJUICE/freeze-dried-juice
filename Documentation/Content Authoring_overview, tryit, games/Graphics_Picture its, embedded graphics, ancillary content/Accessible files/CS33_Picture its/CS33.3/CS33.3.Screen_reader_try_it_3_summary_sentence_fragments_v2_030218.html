<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>There are two ways to fix a sentence fragment. You can write something new to add what the fragment is missing, or you can add the fragment to a complete sentence in your writing.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>You're reviewing an essay you wrote and realize one paragraph has some sentence fragments.</p>

<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Zoos are controversial. For many reasons. On the one hand, they provide a safe home for animals to live and breed. While zoos help endangered species. However, many believe that zoos are cruel because they keep wild animals cooped up in enclosed spaces. Greatly limit animals' freedom.</p>

color:#552656'>Editing the paragraph</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The first sentence, "Zoos are controversial," has a subject and a verb and is a complete sentence. However, the next sentence, "For many reasons," is a fragment because it is missing a subject. You add the fragment to the complete sentence by removing the period after "Zoos are controversial," and making "for" lowercase. Now the sentence is, "Zoos are controversial for many reasons."</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The third sentence, "On the one hand, they provide a safe home for animals to live and breed," has a subject and a verb and is a complete sentence.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>However, the next sentence "While zoos help endangered species," is a fragment because it is a dependent clause without an independent clause to complete the idea. You add it to the previous complete sentence by removing the period after, "for animals to live and breed," and replacing, "while zoos", with the joining word, "and". Now the sentence is, "On the one hand, they provide a safe home for animals to live and breed and help endangered species."</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next sentence, "However, many believe that zoos are cruel because they keep wild animals cooped up in enclosed spaces," has a subject and a verb and is a complete sentence.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>But the last sentence, "Greatly limit animals' freedom," is a fragment because it is missing a subject. You make "greatly" lowercase and write something new to say what limits the animals' freedom. Now the sentence is, "Zoo cages greatly limit animals' freedom."</p>

<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Fixed paragraph</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>You fixed all of the sentence fragments! Now the paragraph is, "Zoos are controversial for many reasons. On the one hand, they provide a safe home for animals to live and breed and help endangered species. However, many believe that zoos are cruel because they keep wild animals cooped up in enclosed spaces. Zoo cages greatly limit animals' freedom." </p>
