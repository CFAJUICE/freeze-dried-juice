          color:#000000'>When you free write, you are typing ideas about your topic that come into your head in any order without worrying about spelling, punctuation, grammar, organization, or even whether the ideas make sense!   You might make notes or comment on the ideas as they come to you and you'll plan to organize the ideas later.</p>

        <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
          color:#000000'>One of the earliest sports (check this).  Called football most places.  Requires little equipment--only a ball.  Or sometimes not a ball (coconuts). People wear cleats, sandals, even bare feet.  Teams can have any number of people--just even numbers on each side.  World cup! I played soccer as a 6 year old and 26 year old  (leave out personal experience?), Soccer leads to few injuries--oops that's not true!</p>

          color:#000000'>It's ok to have mistakes when you are freewriting.  This is just a way to get started gathering ideas.</p>
