<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
          color:#000000'>Hi, I'm Jose. I'm a product director for Widget Company, the world's largest widget builder. Did you know workers in the US use some kind of widget at least 5 times a day? We think the best way to make a great widget is to talk directly to customers about what they want, build at the highest quality, and provide excellent service.</p>

       color:#552656'>Which introduction is more effective?</span></h2 >
 <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Jose's introduction is more interesting and effective because he starts with a sentence that captures Marcia's interest, provides background information about widgets, and closes with three things to discuss further.  This is a compelling introduction.
