<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>You are reviewing and revising the first draft of a paragraph about social media. You are making sure that is has an effective topic sentence, support that proves, explains, or shows what you are saying, sentences that all relate to the topic sentence, transition words, and a concluding sentence that restates the main idea.</p>

    <h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>First draft paragraph</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Social media is unfortunately here to stay. Tons of kids use social media. Checking in to social media sites becomes a regular necessity, and no check in is quick, with new posts appearing every minute. The option to share photos keeps friends and families in close touch with each other.</p>

    <h3 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
        color:#5F9842'>How you improved the paragraph:</span></h3>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The topic sentence, "Social media is unfortunately here to stay," is too broad and doesn't include a main idea. You replace it with, "Social media is here to stay, but for many high school kids, the drama it causes results in wasted time and lost friends." The new topic sentence now gives a topic, social media, and a main idea, social media wastes time and ruins friendships. </p>
    <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The second sentence, "Tons of kids use social media," is too general to be effective support. You replace it with, "Many internet users currently use at least one social media site, and many of these are high school students." Now the second sentence provides specific background information.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>"The option to share photos keeps friends and families in close touch with each other", distracts from the topic by mentioning a benefit of social media. You decide to remove it from the paragraph.</p>
 <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The paragraph doesn't use transition words, so it's hard to tell what is important. The paragraph also needs more supporting details. You add three new details to support the main idea. You also include transition words between them to help the reader understand the importance of ideas.</p>
    <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The paragraph doesn't have a concluding sentence that restates the main idea. You add the concluding sentence, "In conclusion, users of social media should be aware of the ways it can consume time and energy and the effects it can have on relationships."</p>

    <h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Final draft paragraph</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Social media is here to stay, but for many high school kids, the drama it causes results in wasted time and lost friends.  Many internet users currently use at least one social media site, and many of these are high school students.   First of all, an hour previously dedicated to homework shrinks to fifteen minutes after replying to messages, sharing tweets, and investigating a friend of a friend's page.  Next, even more dramatic than the time wasted, is the amount of energy expended on feuds.  Most unfortunate of all, relationships among former friends are lost due to misunderstandings and posts that cannot be retracted. In conclusion, users of social media should be aware of the ways it can consume time and energy and the effects it can have on relationships.</p>
    <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Now the paragraph is much more effective!</p>
