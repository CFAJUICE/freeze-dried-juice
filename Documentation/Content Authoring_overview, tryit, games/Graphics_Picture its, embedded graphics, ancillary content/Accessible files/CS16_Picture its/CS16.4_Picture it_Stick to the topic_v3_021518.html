           color:#000000'>Riding a bike to work benefits the biker as well as the environment. If you can commute to work by bicycle, you will fit daily exercise into your busy schedule.

Finally, by cutting back on the amount of miles you drive in your car, you conserve fuel and cut down on carbon dioxide building up in our atmosphere.</p>
