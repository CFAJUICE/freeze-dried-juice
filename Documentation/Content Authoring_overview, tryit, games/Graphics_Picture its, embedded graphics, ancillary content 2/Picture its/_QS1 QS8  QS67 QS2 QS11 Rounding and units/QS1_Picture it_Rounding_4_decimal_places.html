      <p><img src="Rounding4decimalplaces_image.png" alt="When you round to 4 decimal places, your answer should have 4 digits to the right of the decimal point.  Start by locating the number in the place you want to round to.  Check the digit that is to its right.  If it is less than 5, round down by removing all of the digits to the right of the place you are rounding to.  If it is greater than or equal to 5, round up by adding one to the digit in the place you are rounding to, and removing all of the digits to its right.  Suppose you are rounding the number 167.341821 to 4 decimal places.   The digit in the place you want to round to is 8 and the number to its right is 2.  Since 2 is less than 5, you round down by removing the digits to the right of 8.  Your answer will be 167.3418.   Suppose you are rounding the number 167.341861 to 4 decimal places.  The digit in the place you want to round to is 8 and the number to its right is 6.  Since 6 is greater than or equal to 5, round up by adding 1 to 8, and removing the digits to its right.  Your answer will be 167.3419." style="width:811px;height:431px;">
