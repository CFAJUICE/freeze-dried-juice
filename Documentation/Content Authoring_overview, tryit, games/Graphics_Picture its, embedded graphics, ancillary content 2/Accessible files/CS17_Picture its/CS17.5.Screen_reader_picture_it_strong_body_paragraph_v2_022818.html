<h1 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Build strong body paragraphs</span></h1>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>A strong body paragraph has a topic sentence that tells the main idea of the paragraph and several convincing details that support the topic sentence.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Suppose your essay's thesis statement is, "When early humans began to grow their food instead of simply gather or hunt, they were able to have larger families, to build communities, and to develop systems of simple government." You're writing a body paragraph for the idea that early humans were able to have larger families once they began to grow their own food.</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Paragraph that is just right!</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>This paragraph contains three pieces of support and all of the sentences support the topic sentence. Think of the paragraph's topic sentence as a roof and the pieces of support as columns that hold the roof up.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>When early humans began to grow some food instead of exclusively hunting and gathering food, the size of families began to grow. A consistent food supply meant guaranteed survival of a larger number of children born into a family (This is the first piece of support). In addition, a mother who was able to remain in one location was able to successfully care for more children (This is the second piece of support). Finally, over time, families were able to develop defenses against forces that had previously endangered them, such as animals, weather, or other elements of nature (This is the third piece of support).</p>

<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Paragraph without enough support:</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>This paragraph needs at least one more piece of support. It's like a roof that is only being held up by two columns; there isn't enough to support the topic sentence.</p>

<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;

Sometimes a crop would fail, and a family would suffer the loss of loved ones (This sentence gives a reason why the size of families might be reduced. It does not support the topic).</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The last sentence is like an unnecessary column; it doesn't help to hold up the roof.</p>
