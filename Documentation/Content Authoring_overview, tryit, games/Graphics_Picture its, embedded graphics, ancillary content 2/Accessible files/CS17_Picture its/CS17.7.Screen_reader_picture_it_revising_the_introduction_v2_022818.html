<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>You're revising the introductory paragraph of your essay to make sure that it introduces your topic in an engaging way, has a clear purpose, and contains a thesis statement that clearly states what you believe.</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>First draft</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The first sentence of your introduction is, "It is a really good idea to learn to play a musical instrument." You realize this isn't very engaging and decide to change it.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The second sentence is, "I have been trying to learn guitar for a few years now." You decide this is too personal to be good background information on your topic.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The last sentence is, "Playing music will be one of the best moves you ever make." This is a thesis statement giving your opinion, but it doesn't show a clear purpose or plan for the rest of the essay. </p>  
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Revised draft</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The new first sentence is, "Imagine yourself surrounded by friends, playing the musical instrument of your choice, and leading an energetic sing-along." This introductory sentence is engaging and creates a picture of what you hope to share.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The new second sentence is, "Learning to play a musical instrument may require a commitment of time, energy, and money, but the end result will guarantee numerous benefits for you." Now the background information lets the reader know what goes into learning a musical instrument.</p> 
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The new thesis statement is, "Learning to read music, sing, and play an instrument encourages you to entertain friends and family, improves your ability to focus on a task, and provides a relief from the hectic day-to-day responsibilities." This thesis statement tells the reader why you believe learning to play an instrument is a good idea. It clarifies your purpose for writing, lists ideas in order of importance, and presents a plan for the rest of the essay. </p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The revised draft of your introduction reads: Imagine yourself surrounded by friends, playing the musical instrument of your choice, and leading an energetic sing-along.

Learning to read music, sing, and play an instrument encourages you to entertain friends and family, improves your ability to focus on a task, and provides a relief from the hectic day-to-day responsibilities.</p>
