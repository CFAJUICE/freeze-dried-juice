<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>You're revising the conclusion of your essay.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Your essay's thesis statement is: Learning to read music, sing, and play an instrument encourages you to entertain friends and family, improves your ability to focus on a task, and provides a relief from the hectic day-to-day responsibilities.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>You're revising the first draft of your concluding paragraph, making sure it supports the ideas in the thesis statement, restates the thesis statement using different words, and contains your final thought.</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>First draft</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The first sentence of your concluding paragraph is, "Learning to read music, sing, and play an instrument encourages you to entertain friends and family, improves your ability to focus on a task, and provides a relief from the hectic day-to-day responsibilities." This is your original thesis statement and your conclusion will be stronger if you restate it using different words, but keeping the same idea.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The final sentences are, "Of course, learning music is not a very physically active skill, and we know that we all need exercise. Remember to build in breaks for physical activity when you are practicing your music."  These sentences introduce unrelated ideas and don't support your thesis statement, so you decide to remove them. You also realize your conclusion doesn't have a final thought; you add one to strengthen the end of your essay.</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Revised draft</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The new first sentence is, "When you dedicate the time and energy it takes to study music, you enrich your life in many ways&mdash;including developing your skills as a performer, your concentration, and your ability to relax when life gets too busy." The conclusion restates the thesis statement using the same idea, but different words.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The new second sentence is, "The commitment you will make to attend class, practice, and perform will be well worth your time." This sentence replaces the unrelated ideas and elaborates on the thesis statement.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The last sentence is, "Remember that the music you make is a gift, not only for yourself, but fellow musicians and listeners of all ages." The conclusion ends with a final thought in the form of a personal opinion emphasizing the point you are trying to make.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The revised draft of your conclusion reads, "When you dedicate the time and energy it takes to study music, you enrich your life in many ways&mdash;including developing your skills as a performer, your concentration, and your ability to relax when life gets too busy. The commitment you will make to attend class, practice, and perform will be well worth your time. Remember that the music you make is a gift, not only for yourself, but fellow musicians and listeners of all ages."</p>
