<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Too narrow</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>A narrow thesis statement will only introduce one point you have to make about your topic.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Say your topic is gardening, and your main idea is that gardening is beneficial. An example of a thesis statement that is too narrow is, "Do-it-yourself gardening can save you money sometimes."</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>This thesis statement is too narrow because it only introduces one thing you will say about the topic. It is like a roof being held up by a single column; there isn't enough to support your main idea.</p>

<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Too broad</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>A broad thesis statement is too general and doesn't introduce what you plan to say about the topic.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>If your main idea is that gardening is beneficial, an example of a topic sentence that is too broad is, "Gardening has many benefits." </p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>This thesis statement is too broad because it doesn't help your reader understand what benefits you will be writing about. It is like a roof being held up by too many supporting columns; there are too many potential points and no focus.</p>
        
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Just right</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>An effective thesis statement will name your topic, state your opinion, and let your reader know your plan for writing.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>An example of an effective thesis statement on the benefits of gardening is, "When you take on your own gardening, you can enjoy the delicious flavor of homegrown fruits and vegetables, engage in a healthy outdoor activity, and save money." </p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>This thesis statement is effective because it states your topic, provides a framework for your essay, and lets the reader know what you will say about the topic. It is like a roof being supported by the perfect number of columns.</p>
