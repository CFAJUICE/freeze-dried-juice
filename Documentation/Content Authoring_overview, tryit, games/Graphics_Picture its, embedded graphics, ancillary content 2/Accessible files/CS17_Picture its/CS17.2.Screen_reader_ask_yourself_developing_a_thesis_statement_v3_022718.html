<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>A thesis statement lets your reader know your plan for writing. When you're developing a thesis statement, first ask yourself:</p>

<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>What am I writing about?</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>This will be your topic. Next, ask yourself:</p>

<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Why am I writing?</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>This will be your purpose. You may be writing to share information, convince someone of something, or to tell a story. Your purpose for writing will determine what additional information your thesis statement needs.</p>

<h3 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
        color:#5F9842'>I am writing to share information.</span></h3>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>If you are sharing information, think about the categories you will cover. Include these categories in your thesis statement.</p>
    <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>An example is, "A good student organizes her time; asks questions as needed; and learns from mistakes."</p>

<h3 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
        color:#5F9842'>I am writing to convince someone of something.</span></h3>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>If you are trying to be convincing, think about your opinion, and what reasons best support your opinion. Include your opinion and reasons in your thesis statement.</p>
    <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>An example is, "Everyone should read <i>Wuthering Heights</i> because it is an epic love story, a spine-tingling ghost story, and an unforgettable tale of an orphan who has a powerful effect on the family that adopts him."</p>

<h3 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
        color:#5F9842'>I am writing to tell a story.</span></h3>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>If you are telling a story, think about what hint you can provide without giving away all of the details of the story. This will indicate what you plan to write about to your reader.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>An example is, "I would never have imagined that a ten-minute journey across town would take six hours and end with an amazing surprise."</p>
