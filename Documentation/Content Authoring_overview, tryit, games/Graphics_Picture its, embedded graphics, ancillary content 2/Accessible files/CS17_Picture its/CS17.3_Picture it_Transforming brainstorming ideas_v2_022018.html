<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif; color:#000000'>A writing web is a visual device for organizing your ideas.  You can also organize your ideas into a structured list called an outline.  An essay outline includes a section for each paragraph of the essay.  The first line of each section is called the heading.  It starts with a letter, such as A, and lists the topic and main idea of the paragraph. This is followed by a numbered list of the supporting details. </p>   
    
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif; color:#000000'>The first section of an outline for an essay will list the essay's topic and main idea as the A heading, and then include each of the reasons from the thesis statement in the numbered list.  The second, third, and fourth outline sections will each start with one of the reasons as the heading, and list the supporting details for each reason in the numbered list.  The fifth section of the outline is for the conclusion. </p>

        <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
          color:#000000'>Suppose you are writing an essay about soccer.  You have created a t chart comparing American football to soccer.  For American football, your chart lists that it requires protective gear, teams must have at least eleven players, and it cannot be played on a hard surface. For soccer it lists that minimal equipment is required, teams may consist of any number, and it can be played anywhere.  You decide that soccer is easier to play than American football.   This becomes your essay's topic and main idea and is the heading for the first section of your outline.  The three reasons you listed for soccer become the numbered list of reasons in the first section of your outline, and each reason also becomes the heading for second, third and fourth sections of the outline.  </p>
 <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
          color:#000000'>Based on your T chart, your outline starts like this:<br><br>
        A. Soccer is better than American football.<br>
    1. Minimal equipment.<br>
    2. Teams consist of any number.<br>
    3. Can play anywhere.<br><br>

<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
          color:#000000'>When you read free writing, ask yourself how each idea fits into your essay.  Is it your topic and main idea?   Is it a reason that supports your topic and main idea?   Or is it a detail that supports a specific reason?    Then add the idea to your outline in the appropriate section.  </p>
    <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
          color:#000000'>Here is an example of free writing about soccer:  Soccer,easier to play than American football. One of the earliest organized sports? (Check this) Actually called 'football' in most places. Requires little equipment, only a ball! Or sometimes not a ball (coconuts) People wear cleats, sneakers, sandals, even bare feet. Teams can have any number of people, sides just need to be even. World cup! I played soccer everywhere, street soccer as a kid, field in high school, now in a public park (permit) </p>
        <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
          color:#000000'>The first part of the free writing is "Soccer is easier to play than American football."  This is your topic and main idea and is the heading for the first section of your outline.  The reasons that support this are: "Requires little equipment", "Teams can have any number of people", and "It can be played everywhere". These go in the numbered list in the first section of the outline.  These reasons also become the headings for the second, third, and fourth sections of the outline.  In the free writing, "Only a ball" and "People wear cleats, sneakers, sandals-even bare feet" are supporting details for the reason "Requires little equipment" and go in the numbered list for that section of the outline. The free writing says "Sides just need to be even".  This is a supporting detail for the reason "Teams can have any number of people", and goes in the number list for that section of the outline. The last part of the free writing is  "Street soccer as a kid, field in high school, and public park."  These are supporting details for the reason "Can be played everywhere" and go in the numbered list for that section of the outline.

 <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>One way to generate ideas is to have a conversation with someone else about your topic.  Suppose you are discussing soccer with your friend Carlos.   Think about what Carlos is saying and add his ideas to your outline.
</p>
  <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>
      Your conversation goes like this:  <br><br>
      You:  So, Carlos, do you prefer American football or soccer? <br> 
      Carlos:  There is no question in my mind. I prefer soccer, hands down.  <br>
      You:  Why is that?  <br> 
      Carlos: When I was a kid, I was able to play soccer with my friends and neighbors. We played outside in the street, so we could play every day right after school. <br> 
      You: I guess that is an advantage. You can play any time and with anyone.<br>
      Carlos: Exactly! Another reason is that it's inexpensive to play. I was able to play soccer with just a pair of inexpensive cleats, and really, some people just wore their sneakers!
      You: Sounds perfect!<br>
      Carlos:  And another thing.  Everyone has such a busy schedule that not everyone can play every day. With soccer, there can be any number of players on each team, as long as the teams are even. If the teams are uneven, people can sub in!
      </p>
      <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'> After your conversation with Carlos, your outline is organized like this:</p>
   <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'> A. Soccer is better than American football.<br>
    1. Can play anywhere.<br>
    2. Inexpensive to play.<br>
    3. Any number on a team.<br><br>
    
    B. Can play anywhere.<br>
    1.  This means any time.<br>
    2.  And with anyone.<br><br>
    
    C. Inexpensive to play.<br>
    1. Can wear any kind of shoe.<br><br>
    
    D.  Any number of players on a team.<br>
    1.  Players can sub in  </p>
