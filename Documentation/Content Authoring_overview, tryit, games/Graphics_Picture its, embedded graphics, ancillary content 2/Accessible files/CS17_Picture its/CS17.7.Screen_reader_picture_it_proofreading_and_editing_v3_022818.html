<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Here is the first draft of a paragraph from an essay. You're proofreading and editing it to remove any errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Tip: Spell and grammar checking will find many of these errors.</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>First draft</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The first sentence of the paragraph is, "It is amazing to think about all the services that we pay for that were routinely done by people theirselves as recently as one hundred years ago." The pronoun "theirselves" is incorrect, so you change it to "themselves."</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The second sentence is, "For example, most americans visit the barber or salon for haircuts, hair color, or other services." You notice "americans", which describes people from a specific place, isn't capitalized so you fix it by adding a capital "A."</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next sentence is, "A century ago, some men may have enjoyed the luxury of going to a Barber, many men and almost all women either had a family member cut their hair or simply grew it long." This is a run-on sentence and needs a joining word after "barber" and before "many." You add the joining word "but" to fix the sentence. You also notice that "barber", which describes barbers in general, is capitalized so you fix it by adding a lower-case "b."</p>    
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next sentence is, "Most early automobile services were taken care of by the owner of the vehicle, from changing tires too changing the oil."  "Too" is spelled T O O, which is not correct in this sentence. You fix it by removing one of the O's.  </p>   
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next sentences are, "Finally, when repairs needed to be done around the house. Including plumbing, painting, and construction. The responsibility belonged to the homeowner." These three sentences are all fragments so you combine them into a single sentence by replacing the periods with commas. Now the sentence is, "Finally, when repairs needed to be done around the house, including plumbing, painting, and construction, the responsibility belonged to the homeowner."</p>  
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The last sentence is, "It made me wonder what I am doing now that I will pay for in the future." The verb "made" is using the incorrect verb tense. It needs to agree with the first sentence, which is in the present tense. You change "made" to the present tense "makes."</p>

<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Here is how the paragraph sounds after the spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors have been removed.</p>   
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>It is amazing to think about all the services that we pay for that were routinely done by people themselves as recently as one hundred years ago. For example, most Americans visit the barber or salon for haircuts, hair color, or other services. A century ago, some men may have enjoyed the luxury of going to a barber, but many men and almost all women either had a family member cut their hair or simply grew it long. Most early automobile services were taken care of by the owner of the vehicle, from changing tires to changing the oil. Finally, when repairs needed to be done around the house, including plumbing, painting, and construction, the responsibility belonged to the homeowner. It makes me wonder what I am doing now that I will pay for in the future. </p>
