<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>You're revising the body paragraphs of your essay.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Your essay's thesis statement is: Learning to read music, sing, and play an instrument encourages you to entertain friends and family, improves your ability to focus on a task, and provides a relief from the hectic day-to-day responsibilities.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>You're revising the first draft of the first body paragraph, making sure it contains one main idea, has enough supporting details, and is in the same order as its corresponding idea in the thesis statement.</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Body paragraph 1 first draft</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The first sentence is, "Studying and practicing music improves concentration!" You realize improving concentration isn't the first reason in your thesis statement, so you decide to make this the second body paragraph to match the thesis statement.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The second sentence is, "It can also help you get a job in the future." This sentence is off topic and you decide to remove it.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The last sentences are, "Reading music helps you develop your auditory and visual perceptual skills. When you practice, you blend auditory, visual, and mathematical skills, all the while using your body and your instrument to produce the musical output that makes the magic happen." You realize that your paragraph only has two supporting details and needs at least one more to be convincing.</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Revised draft</span></h2> 
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The new first sentence is, "Additionally, studying and practicing music improves concentration!"  This paragraph is now the second body paragraph and follows the order presented in the thesis statement. You start it with a transition word so this paragraph will flow smoothly from the paragraph before it.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The new second sentence is, "Reading music helps you develop your auditory and visual perceptual skills." Removing the sentence about getting a job has created a unified paragraph.</p> 
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>You add the sentence, "Reading music also requires you to keep count of the number of beats in a measure." The paragraph now has three details and provides more convincing support for your topic.</p> 
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The last sentence is, "When you practice, you blend auditory, visual, and mathematical skills, all the while using your body and your instrument to produce the musical output that makes the magic happen."</p>   
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
