<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif; color:#000000'>Before you purchase any used vehicle&mdash;whether car, truck, or SUV&mdash;You will want to know its history.  Why?  Not every car was driven gently by an experienced, cautious driver.  Many have been through floods, which can permanently damage the electrical system.  Some have been in major accidents that leave the vehicle vulnerable.  Some may even have been stolen.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif; color:#000000'>So how do you go about finding your vehicle's history?  Your first step is to identify the VIN, or vehicle identification number.  This long string of numbers and letters is found in various places on the car: on the driver's side door jam, in the rear wheel well, or at the bottom of the windshield, for example.  Knowing the VIN is the key to unlocking the vehicle's history. </p>
