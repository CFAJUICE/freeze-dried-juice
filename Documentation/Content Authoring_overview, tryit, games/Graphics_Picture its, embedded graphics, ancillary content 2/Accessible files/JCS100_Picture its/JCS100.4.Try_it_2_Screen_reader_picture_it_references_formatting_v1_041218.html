<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Imagine that you have written an essay that includes information from four different sources.  Three of your reference list entries start with the last names of the authors: Browning, Francise, and Santiago.  The other entry does not have an author, so it starts with the title of the work: The pre-owned car lot.  Below is a description of how your list of references should be formatted according to the APA guidelines.</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>APA formatting requirements for the list of references</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Your list of references starts on a separate page at the end of your writing.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The title of the page is References. It is capitalized and centered on the page.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
          color:#000000'>The reference list is alphabetized based on the first letter of each entry, ignoring <i>a</i>, <i>and</i>, and <i>the</i>.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
          color:#000000'>Each source included in your in-text citations has an entry, except for personal communications.</p>
    
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The first entry on your list of references is the entry for Browning.  The entry for Browning is long, so it is formatted with a hanging indent of one-half inch, which means that after the first line of the entry, all other lines are indented.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The entry for Browning begins: Browning, T. (2016, March). Rating the reliability of used cars. <i>The Consumer Advocate, 3</i>(1). The entry continues on the next line which is indented one-half inch: 39-41 retrieved from http://www.consumeradvocate.com/3/1/browning.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Since the list of references is double-spaced, there is an empty line between the first and second lines of the entry for Browning.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The next entry is the entry for Francise.  The list of references is double-spaced with no extra space between entries, so there is an empty line between the entry for Browning and the entry for Francise, which is caused by the double-spacing.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The final two entries are for The pre-owned car lot, and Santiago.  When you alphabetize the list, <i>The</i> in The pre-owned car lot is ignored, so the entry for The pre-owned car lot comes before the entry for Santiago.</p>

    

<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The entry for Santiago has a URL.  </p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>URLs are kept on one line if possible, so this entry begins with Santiago, C. (2016). <i>Some are better than others.</i> Retrieved from. The URL can't fit on the same line, so it is moved down to the second line of the entry and indented.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>The complete reference list entry is: Santiago, C. (2016). <i>Some are better than others.</i> Retrieved from, line break, hanging indent, http://buyerbeware.org/some-better-others.</p>

<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>In each entry with a URL, the hyperlinks are removed from the URLs.</p>
