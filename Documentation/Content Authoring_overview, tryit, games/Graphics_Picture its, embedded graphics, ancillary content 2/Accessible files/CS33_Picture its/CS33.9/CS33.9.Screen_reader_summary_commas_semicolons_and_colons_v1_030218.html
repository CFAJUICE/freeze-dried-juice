<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Commas</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
          color:#000000'>There are many ways to use commas.</p>
 
<h3 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#5F9842'>In sentences with two independent clauses (compound sentences)</span></h3>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Use a comma with a joining word to connect the clauses. Example: Dave didn't feel like cooking dinner comma, so he decided to order a pizza. <br>
If the two clauses in the sentence are short, the comma may be omitted.  Example:  He called and he placed the order.<br>
Careful!  If you use a comma without a joining word, you have created a run-on sentence called a comma splice.

    <h3 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#5F9842'>In a list</span></h3>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Use a comma to separate items in a list.  Include and before the last item. 
  Example: Dave ordered mushrooms comma, peppers comma, olives comma, and pineapple on his pizza. <br>
Use commas between items in a list of phrases. 
  Example:  Dave surfed the internet comma, read some articles comma, and answered emails while he waited. <br>
When an event began in the past and continues into the present, use the verb "have" or "has."  Example:  I have learned a lesson about leaving on time.
</p>
    
   <h3 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#5F9842'>Separating introductory words, phrases, and clauses</span></h3>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Use a comma after an introductory word, phrase, or clause.  Examples: Dave comma, what did you order on your pizza? <br>
The last time Dave ordered pizza comma, he got different toppings. <br>
When he calls the pizza place comma, the employees recognize his voice right away.

       <h3 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#5F9842'>Setting off descriptive information</span></h3>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Use commas if the added information is non-essential.   Dave comma, who had worked hard all day comma, waited anxiously for his pizza.<br>
Do not use commas if the added information is essential. Example:  The driver who delivered the pizza arrived early and got a generous tip.

<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Semicolons</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Semicolons are used to join to independent clauses, or to separate a list of items, when the items in the list contain commas.</p>
    
<h3 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#5F9842'>When joining two independent clauses: </span></h3>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Use a semicolon when clauses are connected in meaning.   Example: Dave orders pizza a lot semicolon; he doesn't like to cook. <br>
Use a semicolon when the 2nd clause begins with a transitional word or phrase. Example:  Dave has many excuses for not cooking semicolon; for one thing comma, he hates doing dishes.    Notice that the transitional phrase is followed by a comma.<br>
When an event began in the past and continues into the present, use the verb "have" or "has."  Example:  I have learned a lesson about leaving on time.

<h3 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#5F9842'>In a series</span></h3>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>Use a semicolon to separate items that already contain commas. Example:  He has tried pizza from Chicago comma, Illinois semicolon; New York comma, New York semicolon; and Rome comma, Italy.<br>
Caution! Do not use a semicolon to introduce a quotation.  Use a comma instead.  Example:   My boss told me comma, open quotes "You are really going places closed quotes."

color:#552656'>Colons</span></h2>  

    <h3 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#5F9842'>In independent clauses</span></h3> 
    
    <p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
          color:#000000'>Use a colon after an independent clause to introduce a list of items. Example:  Pizzas come in these sizes colon: small, medium, large, and extra-large.   Caution!  Never introduce a list with a semicolon.<br>
        Use a colon to join two clauses when the 2nd adds an explanation.   Example: The basic rule for delivering pizza is simple colon: if it's not there in 30 minutes then it's free.
