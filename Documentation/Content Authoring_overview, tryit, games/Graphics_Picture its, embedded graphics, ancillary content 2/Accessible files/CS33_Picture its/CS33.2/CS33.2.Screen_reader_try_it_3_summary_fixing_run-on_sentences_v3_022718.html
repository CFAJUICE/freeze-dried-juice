<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>There are three ways to fix a run-on sentence. You can create two shorter sentences, add a comma and a joining word between the two clauses, or add a semicolon between the two clauses. Here are examples of each technique using the run-on sentence, "Some people prefer little birds such as parakeets or budgies others love big birds such as Amazon parrots."</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Make two shorter sentences</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>You do this by putting a period after "Some people prefer little birds such as parakeets or budgies" and capitalizing the first word of the next sentence, "others." Now the sentences are, "Some people prefer little birds such as parakeets or budgies period. Others love big birds such as Amazon parrots."</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Add a comma and a joining word</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>You do this by putting a comma after "Some people prefer little birds such as parakeets or budgies" and adding the joining word, "and", after the comma. Now the sentence is, "Some people prefer little birds such as parakeets or budgies comma, and others love big birds such as Amazon parrots."</p>
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Add a semicolon</span></h2>  
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>You do this by putting a semicolon after "Some people prefer little birds such as parakeets or budgies." Now the sentence is, "Some people prefer little birds such as parakeets or budgies semicolon; others love big birds such as Amazon parrots."</p>
