color:#000000'>Here is a paragraph with three ideas, but it doesn't use transition words to connect them. Can you tell which step is most important? Will you know if you can skip the last step?</p>

color:#000000'>An important part of helping your child with homework is providing a consistent place for them to work. Make sure this space includes a table or desktop large enough for school materials. Make sure your child always works in the same place. The space should be near you so that you are available to answer questions.</p>

color:#000000'>It's hard to say which step is most important or if any can be skipped. Including transition words between ideas will show which ideas are most important.</p>

color:#000000'>Rice is a quick and easy side dish to prepare. Pour two cups of water into a pot and bring it to a boil. Add one cup of rice and stir. Cover the pot and let it simmer for about 18 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit for 5 minutes. Fluff the rice gently with a fork and serve and enjoy!</p>
