<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Too narrow</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>A narrow topic sentence has too much information or information that is too detailed.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>An example of a topic sentence that is too narrow is, "My stay at your motel last month was a terrible experience for my family and me because of the uncomfortable beds."</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>This topic sentence is too narrow because you plan to write about more than just the uncomfortable beds. It is like a chair with one leg; it doesn't balance with your paragraph.</p>

<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Too broad</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>A broad topic sentence is too general and doesn't have enough information.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>An example of a topic sentence that is too broad is, "I stayed at your motel last month." </p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>This topic sentence is too broad because it doesn't help your reader understand what you will write about. It is like a chair with too many legs; there are too many potential topics and no focus.</p>
        
<h2 tabindex="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#552656'>Just right</span></h2>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>An effective topic sentence will have enough information to narrow your topic and help your reader understand what you will write about in this paragraph.</p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>An example of an effective topic sentence is, "My stay at your motel last month was a terrible experience for my family and me because of the poor quality of the motel and the poor service. </p>
<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif;
color:#000000'>This topic sentence is effective because it tells your reader everything you will be writing about. It is like a well-balanced chair with four legs.</p>
