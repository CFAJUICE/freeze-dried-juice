<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif; color:#000000'>I really recommend that you create a group of interested community members to make a plan.  Make sure your group contains some financial and tax experts and representation from your town government.  Then, work with local suppliers and state and federal governments to see what is available for your community.  I believe that solar is the best solution to lower costs for individual and community electricity needs and to protect the environment for the future.  Check out solar! </p>
