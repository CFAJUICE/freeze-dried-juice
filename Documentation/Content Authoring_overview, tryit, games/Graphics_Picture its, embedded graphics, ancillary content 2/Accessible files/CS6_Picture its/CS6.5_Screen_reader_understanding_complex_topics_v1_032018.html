<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif; color:#000000'>When you are reading about a complex topic, take your time!   Break the reading into smaller sections and use active reading strategies to find the meaning of each one.  Here is a lengthy paragraph about something called the "digital divide" with many unfamiliar terms.  It sounds complicated!   </p>

<p style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:sans-serif; color:#000000'>The digital divide is a term used to describe the discrepancy between individuals who have access to computers and the Internet and those who do not have access. This concept has afforded opportunities for research, analysis, and programming in communities and regions both within a specific state and globally.  While technological advances and the diffusion, or spread,  of various devices that allow connectivity have, according to some, reduced the digital divide, other analysts remind us that inequalities still exist, with older people, racial or ethnic minorities, people with lower incomes, and rural residents still lacking the access and skills that would allow them to bridge the digital divide. A second level digital divide describes the gap between the consumers of content on the Internet and producers of content on the Internet. This second level is more clearly associated with economic status, or income. Individuals with more time to access the Internet can become more creative in their interpretation of information and have the luxury of accessing and exploring the digital tools necessary for content production. Globally, multiple efforts are attempting to bridge the digital divide. Their common goal is to find long-term, sustainable solutions to this inequality by attempting to  provide access to technology, connectivity, and skills that will enable more individuals worldwide to access, use, and learn from digital resources.  </p>
